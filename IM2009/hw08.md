## Problem 1
```cpp=
Algorithm Find_Longest_Path(G(V, E));
begin
    initialize v.length = 0 and v.Indegree for every vertex v in graph G;
    initialize v.previous_point := NULL;
    for all vertice v in V do:
        initialize a queue Q;
        if v.Indegree = 0 then
            put v into Q;
            while Q is not empty:
                remove vertex w at the begin of Q;
                for all edge(w, x) do:
                    x.Indegree := x.Indegree - 1;
                    if w.length + 1 > x.length then:
                        x.length := w.length + 1;
                        x.previous_point := w;
                    if x.Indegree = 0 then:
                        put x in Q;
                end for
            end while
    end for
    v := the first vertex of V;
    max_length := v.length;
    for all vertice w of V:
        if max_length < w.length then:
            max_length := w.length;
            v := w;
    end for
    create an empty stack S;
    while v is not NULL:
        push v in S;
        v := v.previous_point;
    Find_Longest_Path := S;
end
```


## Problem 2
The given way to apply Dijkstra's algorithm to a graph that contains edges with negative cost by adding a constant $c$ is not suitable.  
As if negative edges exist in a given graph, in the algorithm we might allow a cycle to occur as it may cut down the total costs of edge; however, if a constant $c$ is added to every edge and costs of all edges are non-negative, some edges that might be chosen before adding $c$ may have a probability that will not be chosen.  
Since there exist edges with negative cost, the $SP$ values stored in every vertex may decrease in some cases, some vertice will already be marked but it can still has lower $SP$ and requires to recalculate on the points connected from it. Therefore, for a graph with negative-cost-edge, algorithms other than Dijkstra's algorithm should be used.

## Problem 3
Prove by contradiction, we assume that there exist two different minimum-cost spanning trees $MST_1(G)$ and $MST_2(G)$. Listing the edges of the two trees by their cost:
* $MST_1(G): e_1, e_2, e_3, ...$
* $MST_2(G): e'_1, e'_2, e'_3, ...$

Suppose $e_i$ represents for the minimum cost edge in $MST_1$ but not in $MST_2$ while $e'_i$ represents for the minimum cost edge in $MST_2$ but not in $MST_1$.  
Assume $e_i \lt e'_i$, then $MST_2 \cup \{ e_i \}$ will not be an acyclic graph(at least one cycle will appear).  
Let $e'_j$(in $MST_2$) be the maximum cost edge in the cycle, as the cost of every edge is distinct and $e'_k$ has the maximum cost, $e'_k$ should not belong to any minimum cost spanning trees; however, $e'_k$ appears in $MST_2$. Hence, we can know that $MST_2$ is not a minimum cost spanning tree.  
Therefore, the previous assumption that there exist two different minimum-cost spanning trees will fail. In conclusion, we can know that if the costs of all edges in a given connected graph are distinct, then the graph has exactly one unique minimum-cost spanning tree.


## Problem 4
In the given algorithm, it doesn't clearly define how to divide the graph. However, in this algorithm, the way to divide the graph is very important to solve. In the case that the edges chosen and the edges that be cut off can generate **a cycle**, the algorithm may fail to get the minimum cost spanning tree from a graph.

## Problem 5
First, we can define the several cases we may encounter in the problem description, and determine our action to these different situation. 
||$\{ u,v \}$ decrease|$\{ u,v \}$ increase|
|:-:|-|-|
|$\{ u,v\}$ belongs to $T$|No effects|Remove $\{ u,v \}$ from MCST. Search for the edge $e$ with the smallest cost between the two subtrees $T_1$ and $T_2$(the given tree $T$ without edge $\{ u,v \}$ will become two unconnected subtrees), then add $e$ to MCST|
|$\{ u,v\}$ doesn't belong to $T$|Add $\{ u,v \}$ to $T$, and there will occur a cycle in $T$. Therefore, remove the maximum cost edge $e$ in the cycle and delete it from $T$.|No effects|

After we list all the conditions and our actions toward, we can formally write them down as the following algorithm:
```cpp=
algorithm new_MCST(G, T, e{u, v})
begin
    new_edge := e;
    new_weight := e.weight;
    if e exists in T and e increase then:
    	remove edge e from T;
        T1 := Depth_First_Search(T , u);
        T2 := Depth_First_Search(T , v);
        for all edges x connected between T1 and T2:
            if x.weight < min_weight:
                new_weight := x_weight;
                new_edge := x;
        add new_edge to T;
        if new_edge = e then:
            print "No changes";
        new_MCST := T;
    else if e does not exist in T and e decrease then:
        add e to T;
        Cycle := Find_a_Cycle(T);
        for all edges x in Cycle:
            if x.weight > new_weight:
                new_weight := x_weight;
                new_edge := x;
        delete new_edge from T;
        if new_edge = e then:
            print "No changes";
        new_MCST := T;
    else:
        print "No changes";
        new_MCST := T;
end
```

### Time Complexity Analysis
1. If $\{ u,v\}$ belongs to $T$ and $\{ u,v\}$ increase, the time complexity will need to calculate the following:
    * `Depth_First_Search`: $O(|V| + |E|)$; all vertices and edges will require to check and search.
    * The `for` loop search for the shortest path between $T_1$ and $T_2$: $O(|E|)$; at most all edges in $T$ need to be checked. 
    Hence, the time complexity in this case will be $O(|V| + |E|)$.
2. Else if $\{ u,v\}$ doesn't belong to $T$ and $\{ u,v\}$ decrease, the time complexity will need to calculate the following:
    * `Find_a_Cycle`: $O(|V| + |E|)$; there's a `DFS` in the function which is $O(|V| + |E|)$ and we also need to check if any $v$ occurs more than twice in the DFS tree which will be $O(|V|)$.
    * The `for` loop search for the maximum cost edge in the cycle: $O(|E|)$; at most all edges in $T$ need to be checked. 
    Therefore, the time complexity in this case will also be $O(|V| + |E|)$
3. The rest cases we can directly determine that there will not be any changes to the MCST: $O(1)$

In conclusion, we can know that the time complexity of `new_MCST` is $O(|V| + |E|)$.

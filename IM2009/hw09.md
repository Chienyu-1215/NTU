## Problem 1
First, we'll label the given tree following the alphabet order.

### (b)
After adding the new edge, the graph will become:

The new edge $(6,8)$ will create another strongly connected component$(c, e, f, h)$ and also affect on the order of DFS procedure. 


## Problem 2
We'll prove the given statement by **contradiction**.  
If there are two subtrees $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the intersections, since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are in the same strongly connected component, we can surely find an edge from $T_1$ to $T_2$ and the opposite from $T_2$ to $T_1$.  
The edge which connects $T_1$ and $T_2$ must be went through despite which subtree is reached first in the DFS procedure. Hence, the DFS tree T must contain that edge connected between $T_1$ and $T_2$; however, if the intersection of the edges of $T$ with the edges of any strongly connected component of $G$ don't form a subtree of $T$, $T$ clearly doesn't contain that edge (contradiction). Therefore, we can prove that the intersection of the edges of $T$ with the edges of any strongly connected component of $G$ form a subtree of $T$.  


## Problem 3
```cpp=
procedure SCC(v);
begin
    v.DFS_Number := DFS_N;
    DFS_N := DFS_N − 1;
    insert v into Stack;
    v.High := v.DFS_Number;
    for all edges (v, w) do
        if w.DFS_Number = 0 then
            SCC(w);
            v.High := max(v.High, w.High)
        else if w.DFS_Number > v.DFS_Number and w.Component = 0 then 
        //back edge, cross edge to a vertex that has no components
            v.High := max(v.High, w.DFS_Number)
            // max(v.High, w.High) also works
    if v.High = v.DFS_Number then
        Current_Component := Current_Component + 1;
        repeat
            remove x from the top of Stack;
            x.component := Current_Component;
        until x = v
end
```
Since in the `SCC` procedure, only when the `if` condition is satisfied(a vertex $w$ that is reached before $v$(`w.DFS_Number > v.DFS_Number`) and it doesn't belong to any SCC(`w.Component = 0`)), we can finally reach the line of code we'd like to make the substitution.  
If `w.DFS_Number` is equal to `w.High`, then the replacement will have no effect on the program. If they are different, the only case is that `w.DFS_Number < w.High`, which stands for the fact that $v$ and $w$ are in the same SCC. In the algorithm, we'll return the `High` of the vertex which is the leader of this SCC(the vertex with the highest `DFS_Number`), therefire, its `High` will be set to `max(v.High, w.High)`, which will exactly be its `DFS_Number` because the SCC leader will have `High = DFS_Number`.  
Therefore, we can prove that if we replace the line `v.high := max(v.high, w.DFS_Number)` by `v.high := max(v.high, w.high)`, the algorithm will still be **correct**. 


## Problem 4
### (a)
Suppose the function $LCS(s_1, s_2)$ returns the length of a longest common subsequence of two strings $s_1, s_2$: $LCS(s_1, s_2) =  \left\{\begin{array}{} 0 \quad \mbox{(if at least one of the string is an empty string)} \\ LCS((s_1 - 1), (s_2 - 1)) + 1 \quad \mbox{(if } s_1 = (s_1 - 1) + X \mbox{ and } s_2 = (s_2 - 1) + X) \\ max(LCS(s_1 - 1, s_2), LCS(s_1, s_2 - 1), LCS(s_1 - 1, s_2 -1)) \quad \mbox{otherwise.}\end{array}\right.$

Note: $s - 1$ represents for the string that excludes for the last character.

### (b)
$Input = s1 \text{ and } s2(\text{the two given sequences})$
```cpp=
algorithm Longest_Common_Subsequence(s1, s2):
begin
    n1 := the length of s1;
    n2 := the length of s2;
    create a two dimensional array of size [n1 + 1][n2 + 1] named LCS;
    for i from 0 to n1 do:
        for j from 0 to n2 do :
            if i = 0 or j = 0 then:
                LCS[i][j] := 0;
            else if s1[i] = s2[j] then:
                LCS[i][j] := LCS[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            else:
                LCS[i][j] := max(LCS[i - 1][j], LCS[i][j - 1], LCS[i - 1][j - 1]);
        end for
    end for
    return LCS[n1][n2];
end
```
#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm will be $O(mn)$($m$ is the length of $s_1$ and $n$ is the length of $s_2$) results from the two `for-loop` we used when constructing the $LCS$ table.


## Problem 5
### (a)
Suppose the function $LIS(s)$ returns the length of a longest increasing subsequence of any sequence $s$: $LIS(s) = \left\{\begin{array}{} 0 &  \mbox{if }s\mbox{ is empty}\\1 & \mbox{if }s\mbox{ only contains one element} \\ max(LIS(s') + 1, LIS(s - 1)) & s'[n'] \lt s[n] \end{array}\right.$  
Note: 
* $s - 1$ represents for the sequence that excludes for the last element.
* $s'[n'] \lt s[n]$ means that the last element of $s'$(a subsequence of $s$) is smaller than the last element of $s$, if there's no element before $s[n]$ smaller than $s[n]$ then $s'$ is empty.
### (b)
$Input = nums(\text{the given sequence})$
```cpp=
algorithm Longest_Increasing_Subsequence(nums):
begin
    n := the number of elements in nums;
    create an array of n elements called lis;
    for i from 0 to (n - 1) do:
        lis[i] = 1;
    for i from 0 to (n - 2) do:
        for j from (i - 1) to (n - 1) do:
            if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                lis[j] = max(lis[i] + 1, lis[j]);
    return the largest number in lis;
end
```
#### Time Complexity
The time complexity will be $O(n^2)$, $n$ is the number of elements in the input sequence. Since in the algorithm, we use three `for-loop` and one of the three is contained in another one, as well as each `for-loop` all run for at most $n$ elements; hence, we can conclude that the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

## Problem 1
```cpp=
algorithm Find_Euler_Circuit(G(V, E));
begin
    if the degree of any node in G is odd or zero then:
        Find_Euler_Circuit := false; 
        //base on the theorem 2 given in the class on date 11/17
    create an empty list "v_list" for passing vertex ;
    create an empty list "path" for used edges;
    randomly pick one vertex v;
    Euler_Circuit(G, v, v_list, path);
    while there are no edges connected from v_list is not in path:
        pick one vertex w from v_list;
        remove w from v_list;
        Euler_Circuit(G, w, v_list, path);
    if the number of edges in path is not equal to the number of edges in E then:
        Find_Euler_Circuit := false;
    else:
        Find_Euler_Circuit := true;
end
```
```cpp=
algorithm Euler_Circuit(G, v, v_list, path);
begin
    w := v;
    while there is an edge (w, x) connected from w in G and does not exist in E:
        if x = v then:
            Euler_Circuit := true;
        else:
            put edge (w, x) into path;
            put vertex w into v_list;
            w := v;
    Euler_Circuit := false;
end
```
The algorithm we use will at first determine whether the graph satisfies that all nodes have even degrees(exclude $0$); the next step we will first randomly pick one node and start traverse using `Euler_Circuit` function, we'll keep going through any possible edges until we trace back to the node we start; the third step we keep look into the visited nodes and try to go through all the circuits in the graph. At last, we'll check if all the edges in $E$ is visited, if so, we can return true; if not, return false. 


## Problem 2
In definition, we know that since a binary de Bruijn sequence only has **two kinds of bits**, we can know that the each pair of adjacent vertice have the $n − 1$ same bits, the edge will only be label $0$ or $1$, and the out-degree and in-degree of any nodes will all be $2$. *Example: there will be two edges that connected to ==01==0: 1==01== and 0==01==; there will also be two edges connected from 0==10==: ==10==0 and ==10==1.*  
Therefore, since every vertex in $G_n$ will satisfy that $In-degree = Out-degree = 2$, we can prove that $G_n$ is a directed Eulerian Graph.

Because the adjacent vertex will only be one bit different, in the $n$-bits de Bruijn sequences, the number of the vertex will be composed by the previous $n − 1$ edges. *(Example: Vertex 111: 000 -> 00==1== -> 01==1== -> 11==1== )*

Hence, we can also conclude that the sequence will be included all the $n$-bit group as $11010001$ will include all the vertice of $n = 3$ while $111$ will be found in the concatention of two same sequences. 


## Problem 3
**preWORK**:
```cpp=
    v.height := 0;
    v.balance_factor := 0;
    v.left_height := 0;
    v.right_height := 0;
```
In the **preWORK**, we initialize the height, balance factor and the height of the two childtrees of vertex $v$ to $0$ before the start of the DFS traverse.  

There will be two postWORK, while one is the postWORK during the DFS traverse, and the other is after the DFS traverse.   
**postWORK_I**:
```cpp=
    v.height := max(v.height, w.height + 1);
    if w is the left child of v:
        v.left_height := w.height + 1;
    else if w is the right child of v:
        v.right_height := w.height + 1;
```
**postWORK_II** is the way we do the traverse till the end of the route and we'd like to trace back all the heights of vertice from node $w$ back to node $v$.

**postWORK_II**:
```cpp=
    v.balance_factor := v.left_height - v.right_height;
```
**postWORK_II** is the calculation of balance factor of $v$ after the traverse of all its children.  


## Problem 4
Since in the problem description says that $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$, we will not need to check whether there are any cycle in $T$ and whether $T$ is a subgraph of $G$.
```cpp=
algorithm Is_a_DFS_Tree(G(V, E), T(V, T_E), v);
begin
    mark v; //to mark that point v is already visited
    for e = (v , w) is an edge of T_E:
        if e.mark = true then:
            continue;
        e.mark := true;
        if w is marked: //a cycle should not exist in a DFS spanning tree
            Is_a_DFS_Tree := false;
        Is_a_DFS_Tree(G, T, w); // check from w
    for (v, w) in E:
        if w is not marked then: //a cross edge but the vertex w is not visited
            Is_a_DFS_Tree := false;
    Is_a_DFS_Tree := true;
end
```
In the algorithm, we'll marked the vertex we start to traverse first. Next, we'll check all the edges $(v,w)$ which are connected from $v$ in the $E_T$(represents for all edges in $T$), if it's already visited we'll continue our search; if not, we'll mark the edge; if the vertex $w$ is visited, it'll turn out that there's a cycle in $T$, then we'll return false since a cycle should not exist in a DFS tree; if the above steps are done, we'll use recursion to check from vertex $w$ again.  
Then we'll check all the edges $(v, w)$ in $E$, if there's any vertice $w$ that haven't visited, which means that $(v, w)$ is a cross edge, however if $w$ isn't visited, it'll mean that $T$ is not a DFS tree of $G$.  
 

## Problem 5
If an edge $(v, w)$ in $E$ does not belong to the BFS tree and $w$ is on a larger level, then the level numbers of $w$ and $v$ differ by at most $1$ is because $w$ is already visited before the searching for possible vertex through all the edges connected from $v$. 
```cpp=
Algorithm Breadth_First_Search(G, v);
begin
    mark v;
    put v in a queue;
    while the queue is not empty do
        remove vertex w from the queue;
        perform preWORK on w;
        for all edges (w, x) with x unmarked do
            mark x;
            add (w, x) to the BFS tree T ;
            put x in the queue
end
```

If the level number of $w$ is larger and $(v, w)$ isn't in the BFS tree, it must be differ from the level number of $v$ at most $1$; otherwise, $v$ should be the first vertex in the queue of all vertice that connects to $w$ and $(v,w)$ should be in the BFS tree.

如果(v,w)沒有被選擇，代表在Queue中，$v$點之前，必定有一點有一條邊可以連到$w$，而在$v$之前的點必定有跟$v$一樣大、或更小的level number，因此在$w$的level number 較大的假設前提下，$w$和$v$的level number至多差一，否則$(v,w)$會在remove $v$ from the queue時被加入到BFS tree。

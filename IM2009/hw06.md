## Problem 1
For the $\frac{n}{2}$ round, every $i$-th round, the $k$-th player($P_k$) will face a player following the rules:
1. If $k$ is odd, the player will face the $j_{odd}$-th player($P_{j_{odd}}$) where $j_{odd} = \left\{\begin{array}{} 2(k + i - 1) & \text{if } 2(k + i - 1) \le 2n \\ 2(k + i - 1) - 2n & otherwise.\end{array}\right.$ 
2. If $k$ is even, the player will face the $j_{even}$-th player($P_{j_{even}}$) where $j_{even} = \left\{\begin{array}{} \frac{k + 2i - 2}{2} & \text{if } \frac{k + 2i - 2}{2} \le 2n \\ \frac{k + 2i - 2 - n}{2} & otherwise.\end{array}\right.$ 

Using the same concepts above, we can keep dividing the group of people into two subgroups and make one member from one subgroup challenges one from the other. So all we do is, first **divide the players into two groups** and make players from different group engage in one play, and after they'll play with player in the other group, we'll solve **the plays of ingroup players**. Hence, we'll divide the group until each subgroup contains only one or two people and we can finally get the schedule of the $n - 1$ rounds. 

For example there are 4 players, the schedule got from this algorithm will be like:
|Round\Player|$P_1$|$P_2$|$P_3$|$P_4$|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|$P_2$|$P_1$|$P_4$|$P_3$|
|2|$P_4$|$P_3$|$P_2$|$P_1$|
|3|$P_3$|$P_4$|$P_1$|$P_2$|

## Problem 3
In my solution of searching of the given number in the 
set $S$ the way I'll do will just use a ```for-loop``` to search and compare through all the object, which will end up with $O(n)$ times: Let $x$ denote the number we'd like to find in the set
```cpp=
Algorithm FindNumber(x, S):
begin
    for S[i] in S:
        if S[i] == x:
            print "Successful Find"; 
            \\unable to reach due to the problem description says 
            \\that the number we want to find is not in the set
        else:
            continue;
    end for
    print "Fail to Find";
end
```
Since every element in $S$ will be picked out and compared with $x$ once, and there's only one loop use in my algorithm, the time of it will be $O(n)$.  

In the problem description that the number we'd like to find is truly not exist in $S$, which means that every number in $S$ must be read and compare. There are $n$ numbers we need to go through, then there are at least $n$ times we need to go through the comparison and getting the number of the set, which end up the lower bound on the number of steps required is $\Omega(n)$. 


## Problem 4
Let $G(n)$ represent as the sum of the heights of all nodes in a complete binary tree with $n$ nodes. If a tree is a full binary tree with $2^{(h + 1)} - 1$ nodes, we already know that $G(n) = 2^{h + 1} - (h + 2) = n - (h + 1) \le n - 1$. With this, we can prove the following cases of complete binary trees by induction of $n$ of nodes.  

**Base Case**
When $n = 1$, the tree is a full binary tree with only one node and the single node with no children has a height $0$, then $G(1) = 0 \lt 1 - 1 = n - 1$.  
When $n = 2$, the tree is a complete tree with two nodes, and height of the root is $1$, then $G(2) = 1 \lt 2 - 1 \lt n - 1$.

**Inductive Steps**
If the tree is a full binary tree, which means it is of $n = 2^{(h + 1)} - 1$ nodes, then we can prove that $G(n) \lt n - 1$ from the previous solution. Otherwise, if a tree is a complete binary tree but not full binary tree of height $h$, which means $2^{h - 1} - 1 \lt n \lt 2^h - 1$, by observation, we can find there are three cases to be consider: 
1. Of a tree with $n$ nodes and of height $h$, the left subtree is a full binary tree of $n_l$ nodes and the right subtree is a complete binary tree of $n_r$ nodes but is not full. Then we can know $n_l + n_r + 1 = n$. In this case, both subtree must be of height $h - 1$ in case that the whole tree is complete. From the case of any full binary tree and the induction hypothesis, $G(n_l) = 2^{h} - (h - 1 + 2) = n_l - h$ and $G(n_r) \lt n_r - 1$, $G(n) = G(n_l) + G(n_r) + h \lt  n_l - h + n_2 - 1 + h = (n_l + n_r + 1) - 2 \le n - 1$.
2. The left subtree is full with $n_l$ nodes and of height $h - 1$ and the right tree is full with $n_r$ nodes and of height $h - 2$. Then we can conclude that of the tree with $n = n_l + n_r + 1$ nodes in this case is of height $h$. $G(n_l) = 2^{h} - (h - 1 + 2) = n_l - h$ and $G(n_r) = 2^{h - 1} - (h - 2 + 2) = n_r - (h - 1)$; therefore, $G(n) = G(n_l) + G(n_r) + h = n_l - h + n_r - h + 1 + h = n_l + n_r - h + 1 = n - h \lt n - 1$.
3. The left tree is complete but not full with $n_l$ nodes and of height $h - 1$ and the right tree is a full binary tree of $n_r$ nodes of height $h - 1$. Then we can know that the whole tree is a complete binary tree with $n = n_l + n_r + 1$ nodes and of height $h$. We know that $G(n_l) \lt n_l - 1$ from the induction hypothesis and $G(n_r) = 2^{h - 1} - (h - 2 + 2) = n_r - (h - 1)$ from the case of a full tree; hence, we can get $G(n) = G(n_l) + G(n_r) + h \lt n_l - 1 + n_r - (h - 1) + h = n_l + n_r = (n_l + n_r + 1) - 1 \le n - 1$.


## Problem 5
```cpp=
Algorithm Compute_Next (B, m);
begin
    next[1] := −1; next[2] := 0;
    for i := 3 to m do
        j := next[i − 1] + 1;
        while B[i − 1] 6 = B[j] and j > 0 do
            j := next[j] + 1;
            next[i] := j
end
```
```cpp=
Algorithm Compute ReDefine_Next (B, m, next);
begin
    for i := 3 to m do
        j := next[i];
        while B[j + 1] == B[i] and j > -1 do
            j := next[j + 1];
            next[i] := j;
end
```
I use the `ReDefine_Next` function to keep recalculate the `next` table since if $A[j] \ne B[i]$ and $B[i] = B[next[i] + 1]$, we should keep passing the comparison of the character $B[next[i] + 1]$ because we can know that $A[j] \ne B[i] = B[next[i] + 1] \Rightarrow A[j] \ne B[next[i] + 1]$ directly. Using the new definition of `next` table we can search the pattern in a more efficient time-saving way. 

And the new `next` table of the given $B$ will become
| $i$ | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8    | 9   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $B$ |  a   |  b  | a  | a  | b  | a  | b  | a  | a  |
| $Next$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $-1$ | $3$ | $-1$ | $1$ |

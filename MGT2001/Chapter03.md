# Techniques to Describe  a Set of Interval Data
## Frequency Distribution
An arrangement or table that groups data into **non-overlapping intervals** called **classes** and records the number of observations in each class.


## Steps of Constructing the Frequency Distribution
###  Determine $\#$ of classes
$\#$ of classes depending on $\#$ of observations

### Compute class width
* Let $n$ be $\#$ of classes
* Let $M$ be the largest value of the observations
* Let $m$ be the smallest value of the observations
#### Class Width $\ge \frac{M-m}{n}$
### Determine **the upper and lower bounds** of each class
### Count the **frequencies** for each class
### Note on Class Width
* Generally *equal* but not necessarily
* Unequal class width is used when the frequency associated with some classes is *too low*.
* Several classes are combined together to form *a wider and “more populated”* class.
* Possible to form an *open ended class* at the higher end or lower end of the histogram. 


## Histograms
* A Graphical presentation by drawing rectangles
* The **bases of rectangles** correspond to the **class intervals**
* The **height** of each rectangle equals **the number of observations** in that class

### Interpreting Histograms
Based on the heights of individual classes or the overall shape.

### Shapes of Histogram
![](https://i.imgur.com/3RF3qUL.png)
Based on the following characteristics:
* Symmetric vs. Skewness
    * Symmetric
        Draw a vertical line down the center the histogram, the two sides are identical in shape and size
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/vtPzvbY.png)

    * Skewness
        A histogram with a long tail extending to either the right (positively skewed) or left (negatively skewed)
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/8GbZSR3.png)
* Number of modal classes
    A modal class is the one with the largest number of observations. 高於左右兩側資料量，代表其為一峰
    * Unimodal
        A histogram with only one modal class
    * Multimodal
        A histogram with more than one modal class
![](https://i.imgur.com/LGq1Cyl.png)
* Bell Shape
    * A special type of **symmetric unimodal** histogram 
    * Many statistical techniques require that the population be bell shaped. Drawing the histogram helps verify the shape of the population in question.

## Class Relative Frequency
It is often preferable to show the relative frequency (proportion) of observations falling into each class, rather than the frequency itself.
$Relative = \frac{\text{Class Frequency}}{\text{Total Number of Observation}}$
### When to Use Relative Frequencies
* The population relative frequencies are studied
* Comparing two or more histograms
* The number of observations of the samples studied are different
### *Example: Comparing Students’ Performance*
Students’ performance in two statistics classes were compared, differed in their teaching emphasis:
* Mathematical Stats – mathematical analysis and development of theory.
* Business Stats – applications and computer based analysis.
### Interpreting Histograms
* The final mark for each student in each course was recorded.
* Draw histograms and interpret the results.


## Ogive
(pronounced “Oh-jive”) is a graph of a cumulative frequency distribution. We create an ogive in three steps:
1. Calculate **relative frequencies**.
2. Calculate **cumulative relative frequencies** 
3. Graph the cumulative relative frequencies.

### Ogive and Histogram
* Ogives are Cumulative Relative Frequency Distributions
### Interpretion
* The ogive can be used to answer questions like:
What telephone bill value is at the 50th percentile?

## Stem and Leaf Display 枝葉、莖葉
* This is a graphical technique most often used in a preliminary analysis.
* Stem and leaf diagrams use the actual value of the original observations (whereas, the histogram does not).
### Constructing a Stem and Leaf Display 
#### Determine what constitutes a stem and a leaf
From each observation:
* The digits to the left of the decimal point is the stem.
* The digits to the right of the decimal point is the leaf.
#### List **the stems** in a column from smallest to largest.
#### Place each leaf at the same row as its stem from smallest to largest.

### Conclusion
* The observations range from $17.2$ to $22.2$.
* Most of the observations fall between $18.0$ and $20.0$.
* The shape of the distribution is not symmetrical. 
* Half the observations are below $19.5$ and half above it. 


# Describing Time-Series Data
## Data Based on Time
Data can be classified according to the time it is collected.
* Cross-sectional data are all collected at the same time.
* Time-series data are collected at successive points in time.


## Describing Time-Series Data
* Time-series data is often depicted on a line chart (a plot of the variable over time).
* Plot the frequency of a category above the point on the horizontal axis representing time. 
### The Bar and Line Charts
Use bar charts also when the order in which nominal data are presented is meaningful. 


# Describing the Relationship between Two Interval Variables
## Scatter Diagram
Show the **relationships** between **two interval variables**, e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, positive related vs. negative related.


*Example*
A small business owner wants to assess the effects of advertising on sales levels. Paired observation data were collected.  Each pair consisted of monthly advertising expenditure and monthly sales levels.

*Example*
* A real estate agent wants to study the relationship between house price and house size. 
* Use graphical technique to describe the relationship between size and price. 
**Scatter Diagram**
The house size (variable X) affects the house price (variable Y)

# Art and Science of Graphical Presentations
## Effective Graphical Techniques
**“Graphical Excellence” deals with the effective use of graphical techniques.**
### Concise and Coherently
#### Size of Data
* The graph presents large data set concisely and coherently.
* Small data sets are easily summarized with a table.
* One or two numbers can be presented in a sentence.
### Clear Communication
#### Clearly Communicate
* The idea and concepts to deliver are clearly understood by the viewers.
* An excellent chart is one that can replace a thousand words and be clearly comprehended by its readers.
### Encourage Comparison
Graphs are often best used to depict relationships between two or more variables or to explain how and why the observed results occurred.
### See the Substance of the Data
The form of graph is supposed to help present the **substance** of the data, not the other way around.
### No Distortion
* Cannot make statistical techniques say whatever you like.
* Eventually, a reader will see through distortions and deception.


## Minard’s Famous Napoleonic Chart…
* Many consider Charles Joseph Minard’s original time series chart (Figure 3.10 on Page 75) to be the best statistical graphic ever drawn. Why?
### Reason
* Two dimensional space and managed to accurate depict five data variables:
    * size of invading army
    * size of retreating army
    * geographic location
    * temperature
    * time
* The multivariate data is presented in such a way as to provide an intriguing narrative as to the fate of Napoleon’s army.

## Graphical Deception
Things to be cautious about when observing a graph:
* Is there a missing scale? 每個軸的標籤需要標示清楚
* Do not be influenced by a graph’s caption.
* Are changes presented in absolute values only, or in percent form too. 
* Stretching the axis. 直方圖寬度要一致


## Chartjunk
![](https://i.imgur.com/AjysfoT.png)
* 刻板印象
* Design overcome the substance. 
* Contain very little data (3 numbers)
* The idea is not clear (no idea to impart.)
* No analysis associated with the chart.


## Substance Problem
![](https://i.imgur.com/M8oCOQO.png)
* This is a chart that contains only 7 numbers. 
* It’s about baseball teams not books.

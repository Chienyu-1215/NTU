# Statistics: Chapter 2 Graphical Descriptive Techniques I
## Agenda
* Type of Data and information
* Describing a Set of Nominal (Ordinal) Data
* Describing the Relationship between Two or More Nominal (Ordinal) Variables


# Type of Data and information
## Variables
* Characteristics of population or sample that is of interest for us.
* Typically denoted with a capital letter: $X, Y, Z…$


## Value
The values of the variable are the range of possible values for a variable. 


## Data
The observed values of a variable $(x_1, x_2, …)$


## Types of Data (Value)
### Nominal data 標籤資料
Nominal data are **qualitative or categorical** observations
* Data are *labels or names* used to identify an attribute of the element.
* A *nonnumeric* label or a *numeric* code may be used.

### Ordinal data 序位資料
Ordinal data are ordered categorical observations -> 可以排序的
* The data have the properties of nominal data and *the order or rank* of the data is meaningful.
* A *nonnumeric* label or a *numeric* code may be used.

### Interval data 區間/數字資料 
Interval data are quantitative or numerical observations
* The data have the properties of ordinal data and the interval between observations is expressed in terms of *a fixed unit of measure*.
* Interval data are always *numeric*.

## Calculation of Data
* All calculations are permitted on **interval** data.
* Only calculations involving a ranking process are allowed for ordinal data.
* No calculations are allowed for nominal (ordinal) data, save counting the number of observations in each category.


# Describing a Set of Nominal (Ordinal) Data
## Analysis for Nominal (Ordinal) data
The only allowable calculation on nominal (Ordinal) data is to count the frequency of each value of a variable and compute the proportion
### Relative Frequency
Category Relative Frequency = $\frac{\text{Category Frequency}}{\text{Total Number of Observations}}$
It is often preferable to show the **relative frequency (proportion)** of observations falling into each category, rather than the frequency itself.


## Graphical Techniques for Nominal data
When the raw data can be naturally categorized in a meaningful manner, we can display frequencies (Proportion) by
* Pie Chart
* Bar Chart
### Pie Chart 
* A very popular tool used to represent the proportions (relative frequency distributions) of appearance for nominal data.
* Emphasize the proportion of occurrences of each category.
* Drawing a pie chart: First draw a circle; then use the *relative frequencies* to divide the circle into sectors that correspond to the relative frequency for *each class*.

### Bar Chart
* A graphical device for depicting qualitative data that have been summarized in a *frequency, relative frequency, or percent frequency distribution*. 
* The frequency (or relative frequency) of each category is represented by a *vertical bar*.
* Drawing a bar chart: 
    * On the horizontal axis we specify the labels that are used for each of the classes.
    * A frequency scale can be used for the vertical axis.
    * Using a bar of *fixed width* drawn above each class label, we extend the height appropriately.
    * The bars are *separated* to emphasize the fact that each class is a separate category.
* Use bar charts also when *the order* in which nominal data are presented is meaningful.


# Describing the Relationship between Two or More Nominal (Ordinal) Variables
## Contingency Table (列聯表)
* Also called a *cross-classification* table or *cross-tabulation* table
* To describe the relationship between two nominal variables.
* Lists the frequency of each combination of the values of the two variables

## Two Nominal Variables
* Create a contingency table, listing the frequency for each combination of values of the two variables.
* Create a bar chart that represent the frequency of occurrence of each combination of values.

## Agenda
* Statistical Methods
* Key Statistical Concepts
* Computer Software and Example


# Statistical Methods
## What is Statistics
* Statistics is a way to get information from data. 
* Statistics is a tool of creating new understanding from a set of numbers(data). 方法論


## Descriptive Statistics 敘述統計學
* Involves:
    * Collecting
    * Presenting
    * Characterizing
* Purpose: Describe data -> 將資料統整，並描述
* Methods of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a convenient and informative way. 
*Example* Stats Anxiety-> Use the grade data of the previous semester and make graphical description to know whether takes the course or not. 


## Inferential Statistics 推論統計學
* A body of methods used to draw conclusions or inferences about the characteristics (numeric) of populations based on sample data. 
* Involves:
    * Estimation
    * Hypothesis Testing
    * Regression
* Purpose: Make Decisions about Population Characteristics 運用數據特徵做出決策
*Example* Exclusivity Agreement between Pepsi and UT Austin
    * The Agreement:
        * Exclusive right to sell Pepsi all facilities for the next year and an option for future years
        * Pepsi pays a fixed fee 200,000 and 35% revenues to UT Austin
        * Two weeks to respond
    * Background Data:
        * 50,000 students
        * 22,000 cans of Pepsi sold per week
        * No data for other soft drinks
    * Price and Cost:
        * 75 cents per can
        * 20 cents cost to make per can
        * Current market share of Pepsi is less than 50%
    * Market Share will affect on the profit

    * To estimate the Market Share: Conduct a survey to ask students to record the number of soft drinks purchased per week. 
    
    
# Key Statistical Concepts
## Population 母體
* The group of **all items** of interest. Usually very large and may be infinite large.
* A **descriptive measure** of a population is called a **parameter**參數.


## Sample 樣本
* A set of data drawn from the population. A sample is usually very small compared with the population.
* A **descriptive measure** of a sample is called a **statistic**統計值.


## Statistical Inference
* The process of making an estimate, prediction, or decision about a population based on sample data.
* Easier and cheaper than doing census.

## C.L. and S.L.
* Significant Level $(\alpha)$ 風險係數: how frequently the conclusion will be wrong in the long run.
* Confidence Level ($1-\alpha)$ 信賴水準: the proportion of times that an estimating procedure will be correct.

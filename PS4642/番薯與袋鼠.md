## Brief History of Taiwan-Australia Relations

In mid-November 2020, China charged the Australian government with "positioning the bilateral relations." In a Pew Global Attitudes Survey taken in summer 2020, ==81% of Australian respondents held unfavorable views of China==, up from 57% in 2019 and 32% in 2017.

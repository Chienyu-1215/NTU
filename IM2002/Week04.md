# Chapter 2 Decision Making
## Describe the eight steps in the decision-making process
Managers at all levels and in all areas of organizations **make decisions**. That is, they make choices. 
* **Decisions**: A choice among two or more alternatives

### Step 1: Identify a Problem 界定問題
Every decision starts with a **problem**, a discrepancy between an existing and a desired condition.
* **Problem**: An obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or purpose
* 發現問題之警訊：偏離計畫、偏離過往績效、外界批評
* 常見界定問題之問題：人類知覺、解決方案、視狀況為問題

### Step 2: Identify Decision Criteria
Every decision maker has criteria guiding his or her decisions even if they’re not explicitly stated. 
* **Decision criteria**: Criteria that define what’s important or relevant to resolving a problem

### Step 3: Allocate Weights to the Criteria
If the relevant criteria aren’t equally important, the decision maker must weight the items in order to give them the correct priority in the decision. 

### Step 4: Develop Alternatives
* The decision maker to ==list viable alternatives== that could resolve the problem.
* A decision maker needs to be creative, and the alternatives are only listed—not evaluated just yet. 

### Step 5: Analyze Alternatives
Once alternatives have been identified, a decision maker must evaluate each one.   
Sometimes a decision maker might be able to skip this step. If one alternative scores highest on every criterion, you wouldn’t need to consider the weights because that alternative would already be the top choice. Or if the weights were all equal, you could evaluate an alternative merely by ==summing up the assessed values for each one==. 
* 設定決策準則與其權重
* 評估各方案
    * 執行困難度
    * 達成結果可能性和程度
    * 後果或副作用之嚴重性

### Step 6: Select an Alternative
Choosing the best alternative or the one that generated the highest total. 

### Step 7: Implement the Alternative
* Put the decision into action by conveying it to those affected and getting their commitment to it. 
* Reassess the environment for any changes, especially if it’s a long-term decision. 

### Step 8: Evaluate Decision Effectiveness
Evaluating the outcome or result of the decision to see whether the problem was resolved


## Explain the four ways managers make decisions

### Rationality 理性決策
* **Rationality Decision Making**: Describes choices that are logical and consistent and maximize value

#### ASSUMPTIONS OF RATIONALITY 
* 假設
    * 問題清晰
    * 目標清楚
    * 替代方案及結果已知
    * 決策者的偏好一致且穩定
    * 追求最佳解
* A rational decision maker would be fully **objective** and logical. 
* The problem faced would be clear and unambiguous, and the decision maker would have a clear and specific goal and know all possible alternatives and consequences. 
* Finally, making decisions rationally would consistently lead to selecting.

### Bounded Rationality
* **Bounded rationality**: Decision making that’s rational, but limited (bounded) by an individual’s ability to process information
* They can’t possibly analyze all information on all alternatives, managers satisfice, rather than maximize.
    * **satisfice**: Accept solutions that are “good enough”
* **Escalation of commitment**: An increased commitment to a previous decision despite evidence it may have been wrong

### 真實決策情境
* 問題不易清楚界定
* 不會考慮**所有**可行方案
* 無法預測各方案結果
* 追求滿意解
* 擴大承諾的不理性行為
* 群體利益的衝突與政治行為

### Evidence-Based Management


## Classify decisions and decision-making conditions
### Types of Decisions
#### STRUCTURED PROBLEMS AND PROGRAMMED DECISIONS
* **Structured problems**: Straightforward, familiar, and easily defined problems
* **Programmed decision 程式化決策**: A repetitive decision that can be handled by a routine approach
* **Procedure**: A series of sequential steps used to respond to a well-structured problem
* **Rule**: An explicit statement that tells a manager what can or cannot be done
* **Policy**: A guideline for making decisions
#### UNSTRUCTURED PROBLEMS AND NONPROGRAMMED DECISIONS


## Describe how biases affect decision making
### Decision-Making Conditions
![](https://i.imgur.com/hUKfEgU.png)
* **Overconfidence bias**: do or hold unrealistically positive views of themselves and their performance
* **Immediate gratification bias**: describes decision makers who tend to want immediate rewards and to avoid immediate costs
* **Anchoring effect**: decision makers fixate on initial information as a starting point and then, once set, fail to adequately adjust for subsequent information
* **Selective perception bias 定錨效應**: decision makers selectively organize and interpret events based on their biased perceptions 第一印象
* **Confirmation bias 肯證**: seek out information that reaffirms their past choices and discounts information that contradicts past judgments 
* **Framing bias 參照架構**: decision makers select and highlight certain aspects of a situation while excluding others
* **Availability bias 可得性偏誤**: decision makers tend to remember events that are the most recent and vivid in their memory
* **Representation bias 重現偏誤**: decision makers assess the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events or sets of events
* **Randomness bias 隨機性偏誤**: the actions of decision makers who try to create meaning out of random events
* **Sunk costs error 沉沒成本**: decision makers forget that current choices can’t correct the past
* **Self-serving bias**: quick to take credit for their successes and to blame failure on outside factors
* **Hindsight bias**: the tendency for decision makers to falsely believe that they would have accurately predicted the outcome of an event once that outcome is actually known

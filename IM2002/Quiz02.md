![](https://i.imgur.com/dsfxebh.png)

* **organizing**
Management function that involves arranging and structuring work to accomplish the organization’s goals
* **organizational structure**
The formal arrangement of jobs within an organization
* **organizational chart**
The ==visual representation== of an organization’s structure
* **organizational design**
Creating or changing an organization’s structure

### Work Specialization 工作專業化
![](https://i.imgur.com/tFf64YE.png)

* **Work specialization**
Dividing work activities into separate job tasks
* Work specialization makes efficient use of the diversity of skills that workers have. 
* Early proponents of work specialization believed it could lead to great increases in productivity.

#### TODAY’S VIEW
* Most managers today continue to see work specialization as important because it helps employees be more efficient.

### Departmentalization 部門劃分
* **Departmentalization**
    The basis by which jobs are grouped 
    * **FUNCTIONAL** DEPARTMENTALIZATION—Groups Jobs According to Function
    * **GEOGRAPHICAL** DEPARTMENTALIZATION—Groups Jobs According to Geographic Region
    * **PRODUCT** DEPARTMENTALIZATION—Groups Jobs by Product Line
    * **PROCESS** DEPARTMENTALIZATION—Groups Jobs on the Basis of Product or Customer Flow
    * **CUSTOMER** DEPARTMENTALIZATION—Groups Jobs on the Basis of Specific and Unique Customers

![](https://i.imgur.com/2lOK0lM.png)
***
* **cross-functional team**
A work team composed of individuals from various functional specialties

### Chain of Command 指揮鏈
* **Chain of command**
    The line of authority extending ==from upper organizational levels to the lowest levels==, which clarifies who reports to whom
* **Authority 職權**
    The rights inherent in a managerial position to tell people what to do and to expect them to do it
    * **Line authority**
        * Authority that entitles a manager to direct the work of an employee
        * As a link in the chain of command, a manager with line authority has the right to direct the work of employees and to make certain decisions without consulting anyone.
    * **Staff authority**
        * Positions with some authority that have been created to ==support, assist, and advise those holding line authority==
* **Responsibility**
    The obligation or expectation to perform any assigned duties
* **Unity of Command**
    The management principle that each person should report to only one manager

### Span of Control 控制幅度
* **Span of control**
    The number of employees a manager can efficiently and effectively manage

### Centralization and Decentralization
* **Centralization 集權**
    The degree to which decision making is ==concentrated at upper levels== of the organization
* **Decentralization 分權**
    The degree to which lower-level employees provide input or actually make decisions

![](https://i.imgur.com/gwi73Lp.png)
* **Employee empowerment**
    Giving employees more authority (power) to make decisions

### Formalization 正式化
* **Formalization**
How standardized an organization’s jobs are and the extent to which employee behavior is guided by rules and procedures


## Contrast mechanistic and organic structures.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mKA43Lv.png)

### Mechanistic organization
An organizational design that’s ==rigid and tightly controlled==
* Keeping the span of control small at increasingly higher levels in the organization created tall, impersonal structures. 
 
### Organic organization
An organizational design that’s highly ==adaptive and flexible==
* Rather than having standardized jobs and regulations, the organic organization’s ==loose structure allows it to change rapidly, as required==.
* It has division of labor, but the jobs people do are not standardized.
* Employees tend to be professionals who are technically proficient and trained to handle diverse problems.


## Discuss the contingency factors that favor either the mechanistic model or the organic model of organizational design.
### Strategy and Structure
* An organization’s structure should ==facilitate goal achievement==. 
* Research has shown that certain structural designs work best with different organizational strategies.
    * The flexibility and free-flowing information of the organic structure works well when an organization is pursuing meaningful and unique innovations.
    * The mechanistic organization with its efficiency, stability, and tight controls works best for companies wanting to tightly control costs.

### Size and Structure
* There’s considerable evidence that an organization’s size affects its structure.
* Large organizations—typically considered to be those with more than 2,000 employees—tend to have more specialization, departmentalization, centralization, and rules and regulations than do small organizations. 

### Technology and Structure
#### Unit Production
The production of items in ==units or small batches==

#### Mass Production
The production of items in ==large batches==

#### Process Production
The production of items in ==continuous processes==
![](https://i.imgur.com/zIjZx9j.png)

### Environmental Uncertainty and Structure
* Managers try to minimize environmental uncertainty by adjusting the organization’s structure.
* In stable and simple environments, mechanistic designs can be more effective. 
* The greater the uncertainty, the more an organization needs the flexibility of an organic design. 
* The evidence on the environment–structure relationship helps explain why so many managers today are restructuring their organizations to be lean, fast, and flexible. 


## Describe traditional organizational design options.
![](https://i.imgur.com/KQZdsFF.png)

### Simple Structure
* **Simple structure**
    An organizational design with ==little departmentalization==, wide spans of control, centralized authority, and little formalization
    
### Functional Structure
* **Functional structure**
    An organizational design that groups together similar or related occupational specialties

### Divisional Structure
* **Divisional structure**
    An organizational structure made up of ==separate, semiautonomous units or divisions==


## Discuss organizing for flexibility in the twenty-first century.
### Team Structures
* **Team structure**
    An organizational structure in which the entire organization is ==made up of work teams==
* Employee teams design and do work in the way they think is best, but the teams are also held responsible for all work performance results in their respective areas. 
* In large organizations, the team structure complements what is typically a functional or divisional structure and allows the organization to have the efficiency of a bureaucracy and the flexibility that teams provide. 

### Matrix and Project Structures
* **Matrix structure**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/nMRMYVU.png)
    An organizational structure that assigns specialists from different functional departments to work on one or more projects
    * One unique aspect of this design is that it creates a **dual** chain of command because employees in a matrix organization have two managers, their functional area manager and their product or project manager, who share authority.
    *  The matrix design ==“violates” the unity-of-command principle==, which says that each person should report to only one boss; however, it can—and does—work effectively if both managers communicate regularly,
* **Project structure**
    An organizational structure in which employees ==continuously work on projects==
    *  A project structure has no formal departments where employees return at the completion of a project.
    *  Employees take their specific skills, abilities, and experiences to other projects.
    *  All work in project structures is performed by teams of employees.
    *  Project structures tend to be more flexible organizational designs, without the departmentalization or rigid organizational hierarchy that can slow down making decisions or taking action. 

### The Boundaryless Organization
* **Boundaryless organization 無疆界組織**
An organization whose design is ==not defined by, or limited to, the horizontal, vertical, or external boundaries== imposed by a predefined structure

#### VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS 虛擬組織論
* **Virtual organization 虛擬式組織**
    An organization that consists of a small core of full-time employees and outside specialists temporarily hired as needed to work on projects
    
#### TASK FORCES 特別工作組
* **Task force (or ad hoc committee)**
    A **temporary** committee or team formed to tackle a specific short-term problem affecting several departments
* **Open innovation**
    Opening up the search for new ideas beyond the organization’s boundaries and allowing innovations to easily transfer inward and outward
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/kkt8a6m.png)

#### Telecommuting 遠端辦公
* **Telecommuting**
    A work arrangement in which employees work at home and are linked to the workplace by computer
    * Working from home used to be considered a “cushy perk” for a few lucky employees, and such an arrangement wasn’t allowed very often. 
    * Despite its apparent appeal, many managers are reluctant to have their employees become “laptop hobos.”
    * Employees often express the same concerns about working remotely, especially when it comes to the isolation of not being “at work.”
    
#### Compressed Workweeks, Flextime, and Job Sharing
* **Compressed workweek 壓縮工作周**
    A workweek where employees work longer hours per day but fewer days per week
* **Flextime (or flexible work hours) 彈性時間**
    A scheduling system in which employees are required to work a specific number of hours a week but are ==free to vary those hours within certain limits==
    * A flextime schedule typically designates certain common core hours when all employees are required to be on the job, but allows starting, ending, and lunch-hour times to be flexible.
* **Job sharing**
    The practice of having two or more people split a full-time job
    
### The Contingent Workforce
* **Contingent workers 臨時工**
    Temporary, freelance, or contract workers whose employment is ==contingent on demand for their services==
    * As full-time jobs are eliminated through downsizing and other organizational restructurings, managers often rely on a contingent workforce to fill in as needed. 
    * One of the main issues businesses face with their contingent workers, especially those who are independent contractors or freelancers, is classifying who actually qualifies as one.


# Chapter 14 Interpersonal and Organizational Communication
## Define the nature and function of communication.
### What Is Communication?
* **Communication 溝通**
    The transfer and understanding of meaning
    * Note the emphasis on the transfer of meaning: If information or ideas have not been conveyed, communication hasn’t taken place. 
    * For communication to be successful, the meaning must be imparted and understood.
    * Good communication is often erroneously defined by the communicator as agreement with the message instead of clear understanding of the message.
* **Interpersonal communication 人際溝通**
    Communication between two or more people
* **Organizational communication 組織溝通**
    All the patterns, networks, and systems of communication within an organization

### Functions of Communication
Communication serves four major functions: control, motivation, emotional expression, and information.
* Communication acts to **control 控制** employee behavior in several ways. Organizations have authority hierarchies and formal guidelines that employees are expected to follow.
* Communication acts to **motivate 激勵** by clarifying to employees what is to be done, how well they’re doing, and what can be done to improve performance if it’s not up to par. 
* Communication, therefore, provides a release for **emotional expression 抒發情感** of feelings and for fulfillment of social needs.
* Individuals and groups need information to get things done in organizations. Communication **provides that information 訊息傳遞**.


## Describe methods and challenges of interpersonal communication.
* **Message 訊息**: A purpose to be conveyed
* **Encoding 編碼**: Converting a message into symbols
* **Channel 管道**: The medium a message travels along
* **Decoding 解碼**: Retranslating a sender’s message

### Methods
* **Communication process**
    The seven elements involved in transferring meaning from one person to another.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IosiSNv.png)
* **Noise 噪音**
    Any disturbances that interfere with the transmission, receipt, or feedback of a message
    * Include illegible print, phone static, inattention by the receiver, or background sounds of machinery or coworkers.
* Managers have a wide variety of communication methods from which to choose and can use 12 questions to help them evaluate these methods.
    1. ++Feedback 回饋++: How quickly can the receiver respond to the message?
    2. ++Complexity capacity 複雜的能力++: Can the method effectively process complex messages?
    3. ++Breadth potential 可能的廣度++: How many different messages can be transmitted using this method?
    4. ++Confidentiality 機密性++: Can communicators be reasonably sure their messages are received only by those intended?
    5. ++Encoding ease 編碼簡易性++: Can sender easily and quickly use this channel?
    6. ++Decoding ease 解碼簡易性++: Can receiver easily and quickly decode messages?
    7. ++Time-space constraint 時空限制++: Do senders and receivers need to communicate at the same time and in the same space?
    8. ++Cost 成本++: How much does it cost to use this method?
    9. ++Interpersonal warmth 人際的親切感++: How well does this method convey interpersonal warmth?
    10. ++Formality 正式性++: Does this method have the needed amount of formality?
    11. ++Scanability 可瀏覽性++: Does this method allow the message to be easily browsed or scanned for relevant information?
    12. ++Time of consumption 處理訊息時間++: Does the sender or receiver exercise the most control over when the message is dealt with?
* **Nonverbal communication 非言語溝通**
    Communication transmitted without words
    * **Body language 肢體語言**
        Gestures, facial configurations, and other body movements that convey meaning
    * **Verbal intonation 語調**
        An emphasis given to words or phrases that conveys meaning
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/zhHhZkg.png)

### Barriers 障礙
#### COGNITIVE 認知
* **Information overload 資訊過載**
    When information exceeds our processing capacity
* **Filtering 過濾**
    The deliberate manipulation of information to make it appear more favorable to the receiver
    * How much filtering takes place tends to be a function of the number of vertical levels in the organization and the organizational culture.
    * The organizational culture encourages or discourages filtering by the type of behavior it rewards.

#### EMOTIONS 情緒
* How a receiver feels influences how he or she interprets it
* Extreme emotions are most likely to hinder effective communication.

#### SOCIOCULTURAL 語言
Words mean different things to different people. Age, education, and cultural background are three of the more obvious variables that influence the language a person uses and the definitions he or she gives to words.
* **Jargon 術語**
    ==Specialized terminology or technical language== that members of a group use to communicate among themselves

#### NATIONAL CULTURE 國家文化
* For technological and cultural reasons, the Chinese people dislike voice mail.
* In an individualistic country like the United States, communication is more formal and is clearly spelled out. Managers rely heavily on reports, memos, and other formal forms of communication.
* In a collectivist country like Japan, more interpersonal contact takes place, and face-to-face communication is encouraged. 

### Overcoming the Barriers 克服障礙
#### USE FEEDBACK 利用回饋
* A manager can ask questions about a message to determine whether it was received and understood as intended. Or the manager can ask the receiver to restate the message in his or her own words. 
* Feedback also doesn’t have to be verbal. 

#### SIMPLIFY LANGUAGE 簡化語言
* Because language can be a barrier, managers should consider the audience to whom the message is directed and tailor the language to them.
* Effective communication is achieved when ==a message is both received and understood==.

#### LISTEN ACTIVELY 主動傾聽
* Listening is an active search for meaning, whereas hearing is passive. In listening, the receiver is also putting effort into the communication.
* **Active listening**
    ==Listening for full meaning without making premature judgments or interpretations==
    * Active listening is enhanced by developing empathy with the sender—that is, by putting yourself in the sender’s position.
    *  An empathetic listener reserves judgment on the message’s content and carefully listens to what is being said. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/vDOuN3N.png)

#### CONSTRAIN EMOTIONS 控制情緒
* It would be naïve to assume that managers always ==communicate in a rational manner==. 
* We know that emotions can cloud and distort communication. 

#### WATCH NONVERBAL CUES 注意非語言暗示
If actions speak louder than words, then it’s important to make sure your actions align with and reinforce the words that go along with them. 


## Explain how communication can flow most effectively in organizations.
### Formal Versus Informal
* **Formal Communication 正式溝通**
    Communication that takes place within ==prescribed organizational work arrangements==
* **Informal Communication 非正式溝通**
    Communication that is not defined by the organization’s structural hierarchy

### Direction of Flow
#### DOWNWARD COMMUNICATION 下行溝通
* **Town hall meeting 員工大會**
    Informal public meetings where information can be relayed, issues can be discussed, or ==employees can be brought together== to celebrate accomplishments
* **Downward communication**
    Communication that flows downward from a manager to employees

#### UPWARD COMMUNICATION 上行溝通
* **Upward communication**
    Communication that flows upward from employees to managers
    * performance reports prepared by employees, suggestion boxes, employee attitude surveys, grievance procedures, manager-employee discussions

#### LATERAL COMMUNICATION 橫向溝通
* **Lateral communication**
    Communication that takes place ==among any employees on the same organizational level==

#### DIAGONAL COMMUNICATION 斜向溝通
* **Diagonal communication**
    Communication that cuts across work areas and organizational levels
    * Because of its efficiency and speed, diagonal communication can be beneficial. 
    * Diagonal communication also has the potential to create problems if employees don’t keep their managers informed

### Networks 
* **Communication networks**
    The variety of patterns of vertical and horizontal flows of organizational communication
    
#### TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NETWORKS 溝通網路的形式
![](https://i.imgur.com/yWjMgPz.png)
* In the **chain network**, communication flows according to the ==formal chain of command==, both downward and upward. 
* The **wheel network** represents communication flowing between ==a clearly identifiable and strong leader== and others in a work group or team. The leader serves as the hub through whom all communication passes. 
* In the **all-channel network**, communication flows freely among all members of a work team.

#### THE GRAPEVINE 葡萄藤
* **Grapevine**
    The **informal** organizational communication network
* The grapevine is an important part of any communication network and well worth understanding.
* Acting as both ==a filter and a feedback mechanism==, it pinpoints those bewildering issues that employees consider important. 具有回饋及過濾的功能，可以反映出員工所關心的重要事情。
* From a managerial point of view, it is possible to ==analyze what is happening on the grapevine—what information is being passed==, how information seems to flow, and what individuals seem to be key information conduits.
* By staying aware of the grapevine’s flow and patterns, managers can identify issues that concern employees and in turn use the grapevine to disseminate important information. 
* Rumors that flow along the grapevine also can never be eliminated entirely. 

### Workplace Design and Communication 工作場所設計與溝通
* Research shows that a workplace design should successfully support four types of employee work: focused work, collaboration, learning, and socialization.
    * Focused work is when an employee needs to **concentrate** on completing a task. 
    * In **collaboration**, employees need to work together to complete a task. 
    * **Learning** is when employees are engaged in training or doing something new and could involve both focused work and collaboration. 
    * **Socialization** happens when employees informally gather to chat or to exchange ideas. 
* As managers design the physical work environment, two common design elements have the greatest impact on communication.
    * The enclosures and barriers used in the workspace.
        * **Open workplaces 開放工作環境**
            Workplaces with few physical barriers and enclosures
    * The availability of adjustable work arrangements, equipment, and furnishings. 
        * As organizations have moved toward nontraditional work arrangements, the adjustability and customizability of employee workspace have become essential and influence organizational communication. 


## Describe how the Internet and social media affect managerial communication and organizations.
### The 24/7 Work Environment
IT has made it possible for people in organizations to be fully accessible, at any time, regardless of where they are. 

### Working from Anywhere
Employees don’t have to be at their desks to ommunicate with others in the organization. As wireless technology continues to improve, we’ll see more organizational members using it as a way to collaborate and share information.

### Social Media
Employees—working in teams or as individuals—need information to make decisions and to do their work. It’s clear that technology can significantly affect the way that organizational members communicate, share information, and do their work.

### Balancing the Pluses and Minuses
* Communication and the exchange of information among organizational members are no longer constrained by geography or time. 
* Collaborative work efforts among widely dispersed individuals and teams, sharing of information, and integration of decisions and work throughout an entire organization have the potential to increase organizational efficiency and effectiveness. 
* Communication expert Maura Thomas said: “Creativity, inspiration, and motivation are your competitive advantage, but they are also depletable resources that need to be recharged.”

### Choosing the Right Media
* It becomes important for managers to understand the situations in which one or more media facilitates effective communication. 
* Exchanging confidential information about an employee’s performance or a company’s competitive secrets should be left for face-to-face meetings or telephone conversations.
* The electronic form of face-to-face meetings, videoconferencing, can bring geographically dispersed colleagues together to share multiple perspectives of key stakeholders. 


## Summarize communication issues in today’s organizations.
### Managing Communication in a Digitally Connected World
#### LEGAL AND SECURITY ISSUES 法律及安全議題
* Although e-mail, blogs, tweets, and other forms of online communication are quick and easy ways to communicate, managers need to be aware of potential legal problems from inappropriate usage. 
* Security breaches are a reminder that computer networks are not impenetrable.

#### PERSONAL INTERACTION 人際互動
* Even when two people are communicating face-to-face, understanding is not always achieved. 
* It can be especially challenging to achieve understanding and collaborate on getting work done when communication takes place in a virtual environment. 
* In some situations and at certain times, personal interaction isn’t physically possible—your colleagues work across the continent or even across the globe.

### Managing the Organization’s Knowledge Resources
What today’s managers need to do with the organization’s knowledge resources — make it easy for employees to communicate and share their knowledge so they can learn from each other ways to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently.

### The Role of Communication in Customer Service
* An organization with a strong service culture already values taking care of customers—finding out what their needs are, meeting those needs, and following up to make sure that their needs were met satisfactorily. 
* Communication also is important to the individual service provider or contact employee. The quality of the interpersonal interaction between the customer and that contact employee does influence customer satisfaction, especially when the serviceencounter isn’t up to expectations.

### Getting Employee Input
![](https://i.imgur.com/DTnEfZi.png)

### Communicating Ethically
* **Ethical communication 道德的溝通**
    Communication that includess ==all relevant information, is true in every sense==, and is not deceptive in any way
    * Unethical communication often distorts the truth or manipulates audiences. 
    *  It’s unethical to plagiarize 抄襲, which is “presenting someone else’s words or other creative product as your own.”


## Discuss how to become a better communicator.
### Sharpening Your Persuasion Skills
* **Persuasion skills**
    Skills that enable a person to influence others to change their minds or behavior
    
### Sharpening Your Speaking Skills
* **Speaking skills**
    Skills that refer to the ability to communicate information and ideas in talking so others will understand
* Once you develop greater confidence to speak before others, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of effective speaking. 
    
### Sharpening Your Writing Skills
* **Writing skills**
    Skills that entail communicating effectively in text as appropriate for the needs of the audience
* Additional points:
    * First, don’t be in a rush to press the send button or drop the memo in the mail. Set your message aside; then, review it with fresh eyes. You might also ask a colleague to review it. 
    * Second, express information and ideas logically and don’t switch back and forth between topics. 
    * Third, check the accuracy of the content. 
    * Finally, read the message carefully to ensure that an inaccurate word for the context doesn’t slip in. 

### Sharpening Your Reading Skills
* **Reading skills**
    Skills that entail an understanding of written sentences and paragraphs in work-related documents.


# Chapter 15 Organizational Behavior
## Identify the focus and goals of individual behavior within organizations.
* **Behavior**
    The actions of people
* **Organizational behavior (OB)**
    The study of the actions of people at work  
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/DZJdL6j.png)

### Focus of Organizational Behavior
* Based predominantly on contributions from psychologists, this area includes such topics as attitudes, personality, perception, learning, and motivation. 
* OB is concerned with group behavior, which includes norms, roles, team building, leadership, and conflict. 
* OB also looks at organizational aspects including structure, culture, and human resource policies and practices. 

### Goals of Organizational Behavior
The goals of OB are to explain, predict, and influence behavior.  
Six important ones have been identified: ==employee productivity, absenteeism, turnover, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), job satisfaction, 
and counterproductive workplace behavior==. 
* **Employee productivity**
    A performance measure of both efficiency and effectiveness
* **Absenteeism**
    The failure to show up for work
* **Turnover**
    The voluntary and involuntary permanent withdrawal from an organization
* **Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)**
    Discretionary behavior that is not part of an employee’s formal job requirements, but which promotes the effective functioning of the organization 部屬之間若存在不求組織給予獎賞，仍然能自動自發、利他助人，關心組織績效的行為，能進一步為團隊帶來正向的成長。
* **Job satisfaction**
    An employee’s general attitude toward his or her job
* **Counterproductive workplace behavior 反生產工作行為**
    Any intentional employee behavior that is potentially damaging to the organization or to individuals within the organization


## Explain the role that attitudes play in job performance.
* **Attitudes**
    Evaluative statements, either favorable or unfavorable, concerning objects, people, or events
* An attitude is made up of three components: cognition, affect, and behavior.
    * **Cognitive component 認知成分**
        That part of an attitude that’s made up of the beliefs, opinions, knowledge, or information held by a person 
    * **Affective component 情感成分**
        That part of an attitude that’s the emotional or feeling part
    * **Behavioral component 行為成分**
        That part of an attitude that refers to an intention to behave in a certain way toward someone or something
        
### Job Satisfaction
#### HOW SATISFIED ARE EMPLOYEES? 
* It’s more likely that the reports of higher satisfaction among higher-income levels reflect those factors rather than the pay itself.
* The global recession likely had an impact on global job satisfaction rates. 

#### SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY
After the Hawthorne Studies (discussed in the Management History Module), managers believed that happy workers were productive workers. Also, ==organizations with more satisfied employees tend to be more effective than organizations with fewer satisfied employees==.
 
#### SATISFACTION AND ABSENTEEISM 
Although research shows that ==satisfied employees have lower levels of absenteeism than dissatisfied employees, the correlation isn’t strong==. It certainly makes sense that dissatisfied employees are more likely to miss work, but other factors affect the relationship. 

#### SATISFACTION AND TURNOVER
Research on the relationship between satisfaction and turnover is much stronger. ==Satisfied employees have lower levels of turnover, while dissatisfied employees have higher levels of turnover.==  
Research suggests that the level of satisfaction is less important in predicting turnover for superior performers because the organization typically does everything it can to keep them—pay raises, praise, increased promotion opportunities, and so forth.

#### JOB SATISFACTION AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
In service organizations, customer retention and defection are highly dependent on how frontline employees deal with customers. ==Satisfied employees are more likely to be friendly, upbeat, and responsive, which customers appreciate==. And because satisfied employees are less likely to leave their jobs, customers are more likely to encounter familiar faces and receive experienced service. These qualities help build customer satisfaction and loyalty.  
==Dissatisfied customers can increase an employee’s job dissatisfaction.== Employees who have regular contact with customers report that rude, thoughtless, or unreasonably demanding customers adversely affect their job satisfaction.

#### JOB SATISFACTION AND OCB
It seems logical to assume that job satisfaction should be a major determinant of an employee’s OCB. Satisfied employees would seem more likely to talk positively about the organization, help others, and go above and beyond normal job expectations. Research suggests a modest overall relationship between job satisfaction and OCB.29 But that relationship is tempered by perceptions of fairness.  
Another factor that influences individual OCB is the type of citizenship behavior a person’s work group exhibits. In a work group with low group-level OCB, any individual in that group who engaged in OCB had higher job performance ratings. 

#### JOB SATISFACTION AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR 
When employees are dissatisfied with their jobs, they are likely to engage in counterproductive behaviors.


### Job Involvement and Organizational Commitment
* **Job involvement**
    The degree to which an employee ==identifies with his or her job, actively participates in it==, and considers his or her job performance to ==be important to self-worth==
* **Organizational commitment 組織承諾**
    The degree to which an employee identifies with a particular organization and its goals and wishes to ==maintain membership in that organization==
    * Research suggests that organizational commitment also leads to lower levels of both absenteeism and turnover and, in fact, is a better indicator of turnover than job satisfaction
* **Perceived organizational support 感受組織支持理論**
    Employees’ general belief that their organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being 指出組織員工會對其機構形成某種整體的感受，認為機構是否重視他們的貢獻以及關心他們的福祉。
    * High levels of perceived organizational support lead to increased job satisfaction and lower turnover.


### Employee Engagement
* **Employee engagement**
    When employees are connected to, satisfied with, and enthusiastic about their jobs
    * Highly engaged employees are passionate about and deeply connected to their work, and disengaged employees have essentially “checked out” and don’t care.
* Highly engaged employees are two-and-a-half times more likely to be top performers than their less-engaged coworkers. 
* Companies with highly engaged employees have higher retention rates, which help keep recruiting and training costs low. 


### Attitudes and Consistency
Research has generally concluded that people seek consistency among their attitudes and between their attitudes and behavior. This tendency means that individuals try to reconcile differing attitudes and align their attitudes and behavior so they appear rational and consistent. When they encounter an inconsistency, individuals will do something to make it consistent by altering the attitudes, altering the behavior, or rationalizing the inconsistency.


### Cognitive Dissonance Theory
* **Cognitive dissonance 認知失調**
    Any incompatibility or inconsistency between ==attitudes or between behavior and attitudes==
*  Reduce dissonance is determined by three things: 
    1. the **importance** of the factors creating the dissonance
    2. the degree of **influence** the individual believes he or she has over those factors
    3. the **rewards** that may be involved in dissonance.

### Attitude Surveys
* **Attitude surveys 意向調查**
    Surveys that elicit responses from employees through questions about how they feel about their jobs, work groups, supervisors, or the organization
* Regularly surveying employee attitudes provides managers with valuable feedback on how employees perceive their working conditions. Policies and practices that managers view as objective and fair may not be seen that way by employees.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/l4cw5uM.png)

### Implications for Managers
* Managers should be interested in their employees’ attitudes because they influence behavior. 
* Managers should also survey employees about their attitudes. 
* Managers should know that employees will try to reduce dissonance. 


## Describe different personality theories.
* **Personality**
    The unique combination of emotional, thought, and behavioral patterns that affect how a person reacts to situations and interacts with others
    
### MBTI®
On the basis of their answers, individuals are classified as exhibiting a preference in four categories: extraversion or introversion (E or I), sensing or intuition (S or N), thinking or feeling (T or F), and judging or perceiving (J or P). 

#### Extraversion (E) Versus Introversion (I) 性格外向/內向
* Individuals showing a preference for **extraversion** are outgoing, social, and assertive. 
* Individuals showing a preference for **introversion** are quiet and shy. 

#### Sensing (S) Versus Intuition (N) 實感/直覺
* Sensing types are practical and prefer routine and order. 
* Intuition types rely on unconscious processes and look at the “big picture.”

#### Thinking (T) Versus Feeling (F) 感性/理性
* Thinking types use reason and logic to handle problems. 
* Feeling types rely on their personal values and emotions. 
#### Judging (J) Versus Perceiving (P ) 判斷/感知
* Judging types want control and prefer their world to be ordered and structured. 
* Perceiving types are flexible and spontaneous.

### The Big Five Model
* **Big Five Model**
    Personality trait model that includes extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness to experience
1. **Extraversion 外向性**: The degree to which someone is sociable, talkative, assertive, and comfortable in relationships with others.
2. **Agreeableness 隨和、順從**: The degree to which someone is good-natured, cooperative, and trusting.
3. **Conscientiousness 勤勉盡責**: The degree to which someone is reliable, responsible, dependable, persistent, and achievement oriented.
4. **Emotional stability 情緒不穩定性**: The degree to which someone is calm, enthusiastic, and secure (positive) or tense, nervous, depressed, and insecure (negative).
5. **Openness to experience 經驗開放性**: The degree to which someone has a wide range of interests and is imaginative, fascinated with novelty, artistically sensitive, and intellectual.

### Additional Personality Insights
1. **Locus of Control 內控**. 
    A personality attribute that measures the degree to which people believe they control their own fate
    * Some people believe they control their own fate. Others see themselves as pawns, believing that what happens to them in their lives is due to luck or chance.
2. **Machiavellianism 馬基雅維利主義**.
    A measure of the degree to which people are pragmatic 務實, maintain emotional distance, and believe that ends justify means 在人際關係處理，不露聲色的冷淡、冷漠和對道德的摒棄。
3. **Self-Esteem**.
    An individual’s degree of like or dislike for himself or herself
    * Self-esteem is directly related to expectations for success. Those high in SE believe they possess the ability they need to succeed at work.
    * Low SEs are more susceptible to external influence than high SEs.
    * Self-esteem has also been found to be related to job satisfaction. 
4. **Self-Monitoring 自行監測**.
    A personality trait that ==measures the ability to adjust behavior to external situational factors==
    * Individuals high in self-monitoring show considerable adaptability in adjusting their behavior. 
    *  Research on self-monitoring suggests that high self-monitors pay closer attention to the behavior of others and are more flexible than low self-monitors.
5. **Risk-Taking**. 
    Differences in the propensity to assume or to avoid risk have been shown to affect how long it takes managers to make a decision and how much information they require before making their choice. 

#### OTHER PERSONALITY TRAITS
* Type A personality
    someone who is continually and aggressively struggling to achieve more and more in less and less time
* **Proactive personality 前瞻性人格**
    A personality trait that describes individuals who are more prone to take actions to influence their environments
* **Resilience 彈性**
    An individual’s ability to overcome challenges and turn them into opportunities
    
### Personality Types in Different Cultures
* We know that no personality type is common for a given country. Yet a country’s culture influences the dominant personality characteristics of its people.
* National cultures differ in terms of the degree to which people believe they control their environment.

### Emotions and Emotional Intelligence
* **Emotions**
    Intense feelings that are directed at someone or something
* Six universal emotions: ==anger, fear, sadness, happiness, disgust, and surprise==.
* People respond differently to identical emotion-provoking stimuli. In some cases, differences can be attributed to a person’s personality and because people vary in their ability to express emotions. 
* **Emotional intelligence (EI)**
    The ability to notice and to manage emotional cues and information
    * **Self-awareness 自我意識**: The ability to be aware of what you’re feeling.
    * **Self-management 自我管理**: The ability to manage one’s own emotions and impulses.
    * **Self-motivation 自我激勵**: The ability to persist in the face of setbacks and failures.
    * **Empathy 同理**: The ability to sense how others are feeling.
    * **Social skills**: The ability to handle the emotions of others.

### Implications for Managers
The best-documented personality-job fit theory was developed by psychologist John Holland, who identified six basic personality types. His theory states that an employee’s satisfaction with his or her job, as well as his or her likelihood of leaving that job, depends on the degree to which the individual’s personality matches the job environment.  
Holland’s theory proposes that satisfaction is highest and turnover lowest when ==personality and occupation are compatible==.

## Describe perception and factors that influence it.
* **Perception 知覺**
    A process by which we give meaning to our environment by organizing and interpreting sensory impressions
### Factors That Influence Perception
A number of factors act to shape and sometimes distort perception. These factors are in the perceiver, in the target being perceived, or in the situation in which the perception occurs.
* When a person looks at a target and attempts to interpret what he or she sees, the individual’s personal characteristics will heavily influence the interpretation. 
* The characteristics of the target being observed can also affect what’s perceived. 

### Attribution Theory
* **Attribution theory 歸因(理)論**
    A theory used to explain how we judge people differently depending on what meaning we attribute to a given behavior
#### Distinctiveness 獨特性
Whether an individual displays different behaviors in different situations. 
* If it’s unusual, the observer is likely to attribute the behavior to external forces, something beyond the control of the person. However, if the behavior isn’t unusual, it will probably be judged as internal.

#### Consensus 共識性
If everyone who’s faced with a similar situation responds in the same way.
* If consensus is high, you’re likely to give an external attribution to the employee’s tardiness; that is, some outside factor—maybe road construction or a traffic accident—caused the behavior.

#### Consistency 一致性
Does the person engage in the behaviors regularly and consistently? Does the person respond the same way over time?
* The more consistent the behavior, the more the observer is inclined to attribute it to internal causes.

* **Fundamental attribution error**
    The tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal factors when making judgments about the behavior of others
* **Self-serving bias**
    The tendency for individuals to attribute their own successes to internal factors while putting the blame for failures on external factors

### Shortcuts Used in Judging Others
* **Assumed similarity 設想相似性**
    The assumption that others are like oneself
* **Stereotyping**
    Judging a person based on a perception of a group to which that person belongs
* **Halo effect**
    A general impression of an individual based on a ==single characteristic==

### Implications for Managers
* Managers need to recognize that their employees react to perceptions, not to reality. 
* Pay close attention to how employees perceive both their jobs and management actions.


## Discuss learning theories and their relevance in shaping behavior.
* **Learning**
    Any relatively permanent change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience

### Operant Conditioning
* **Operant conditioning 導致性條件**
    A theory of learning that says ==behavior is a function of its consequences==
* People learn to behave to get something they want or to avoid something they don’t want.
* Operant behavior is voluntary or learned behavior, not reflexive or unlearned behavior.
* The tendency to repeat learned behavior is influenced by reinforcement or lack of reinforcement that happens as a result of the behavior. 
* B. F. Skinner’s research widely expanded our knowledge of operant conditioning.
    * Behavior is assumed to be determined from without—that is, learned—rather than from within—reflexive or unlearned. 
    * People will most likely engage in desired behaviors if they are positively reinforced for doing so, and rewards are most effective if they immediately follow the desired response. 

### Social Learning
* **Social learning theory**
    A theory of learning that says people can learn through ==observation and direct experience==
1. **Attentional processes 注意階段**. People learn from a model when they recognize and pay attention to its critical features. 指在觀察學習時，個體必須注意楷模所表現的行為特徵(名義刺激)，並了解該行為的意義(功能刺激)。否則無從經由模仿而成為自己的行為。
2. **Retention processes 保持階段**. A model’s influence will depend on how well the individual ==remembers the model’s action==, even after the model is no longer readily available. 指個體觀察到楷模的行為之後，必須將觀察所見轉換為表徵性的心像(把楷模行動的樣子記下來)，或表徵性的語言符號(能用語言描述楷模的行為)，方可以保留在記憶中。
3. **Motor reproduction processes 再生階段**. After a person has seen a new behavior by observing the model, the watching must become doing. 指個體對楷模的行為表現觀察過後，納入記憶，其後再就記憶所及將楷模的行為，==以自己的行動表現出來==。換言之，在觀察早期的注意與保持階段，不僅由楷模行為學到觀念，而且也經模仿學到了行動。
4. **Reinforcement processes 動機階段**. Individuals will be motivated to exhibit the modeled behavior if positive incentives or rewards are provided. 指個體不僅經由觀察模仿從楷模身上學到了行為，而且也願意在適當的時機將學得的行為表現出來。

### Shaping: A Managerial Tool
* **Shaping behavior 行為塑造**
    The process of guiding learning in graduated steps using reinforcement or lack of reinforcement
* Four ways to shape behavior include positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction. 
    * When a behavior is followed by something pleasant, such as praising an employee for a job well done, it’s called **positive reinforcement**. 
    * Rewarding a response by eliminating or withdrawing something unpleasant is **negative reinforcement**.
    * **Punishment** penalizes undesirable behavior and will eliminate it. 
    * Eliminating any reinforcement that’s maintaining a behavior is called **extinction**.
* Both positive and negative reinforcement result in learning. They ==strengthen a desired behavior and increase the probability that the desired behavior will be repeated==. Both punishment and extinction also result in learning, but do so by weakening an undesired behavior and decreasing its frequency.

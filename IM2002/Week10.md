# Chapter 16 Being an Effective Leader

## Early leadership theories
### Leadership Traits
Researchers eventually recognized that traits alone were not sufficient for identifying effective leaders since explanations based solely on traits ignored the interactions of leaders and their group members as well as situational factors. Possessing the appropriate traits only made it more likely that an individual would be an effective leader.

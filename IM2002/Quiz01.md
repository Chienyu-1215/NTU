### Gaining Insights into Life at Work

# Chapter 3 
## Contrast the actions of managers according to the omnipotent and symbolic views.
### Omnipotent View of Management 管理萬能論
The view that managers are ==directly responsible== for an organization’s success or failure  
* consistent with the stereotypical picture of the take-charge business executive who overcomes any obstacle in seeing that the organization achieves its goals 績效考核注重結果
* Differences in an organization’s performance are assumed to be due to the decisions and actions of its managers 管理者需要對每個決策負責

### Symbolic View of Management 管理象徵論
The view that much of an organization’s success or failure is ==due to external forces outside managers’ control==  
* a manager’s ability to affect performance outcomes is influenced and constrained by external factors 管理者對實際的組織成果的影響是極其有限的
* unreasonable to expect managers to significantly affect an organization’s performance
* influenced by factors over which managers have little control, such as the economy, customers, governmental policies, competitors’ actions, industry conditions, and decisions made by previous managers

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZhXP0SN.png)

In reality, managers are neither all-powerful nor helpless. But their decisions and 
actions are constrained.


## Describe the constraints and challenges facing managers in today’s external environment. - Develop your skill at scanning the environment so you can anticipate and interpret changes taking place.
* **External environment 外在環境**: Those factors and forces outside the organization that affect its performance
    * The **economic** component: 
        * interest rates 
        * inflation 
        * changes in disposable income 
        * stock market fluctuations
        * business cycle stages 
    *  The **demographic** component 人口因素: trends in population characteristics
        * age
        * race
        * gender
        * education level
        * geographic location
        * income
        * family composition
    *  The **political/legal** component 政治、法律因素:
        * federal 
        * state
        * local laws
        * global laws and laws of other countries
        * a country’s political conditions and stability
    * The **sociocultural** component: societal and cultural factors 社會、文化因素
        * values
        * attitudes 
        * trends 
        * traditions 
        * lifestyles 
        * beliefs 
        * tastes
        * patterns of behavior 
    * The **technological** component 技術因素: scientific or industrial innovations 
    * The **global** component 全球因素: those issues associated with globalization and a world economy  

![](https://i.imgur.com/agkR4jC.png)  

We’re going to take a closer look at two of them—==the economic and demographic==—by looking at how changes taking place in those components constrain managers and organizations

### The Economic Environment
#### THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT
* The lingering global economic challenges—once described as the **“Great Recession” 經濟大衰退** by some analysts—began with turmoil in home mortgage markets in the United States, as many homeowners found themselves unable to make their mortgage payments.
* Credit was no longer readily available to fund business activities
* The slow, fragile recovery of global economies has continued to be a constraint on organizational decisions and actions. 
    * The global economy appears to be strengthening, global growth is **still sluggish 遲緩**.
    * Two significant risks facing business leaders and policy makers over the next decade: ==severe income disparity 嚴重收入差距 and chronic fiscal imbalances 長期財政失衡==.
#### ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT 
* majorities in each of 44 countries surveyed believe that the gap between rich and poor is a “big problem,” and in 28 of the nations, majorities believe that the gap is a “very big problem.”
* Our acceptance of an ever-increasing income gap may be diminishing
* As economic growth has languished 煎熬 and sputtered 勉強, and as people’s belief that anyone could grab hold of an opportunity and have a decent shot at prosperity has wavered, social discontent over growing income gaps has increased

### The Demographic Environment
Demography is destiny: the size and characteristics of a country’s population can have a significant effect on what it’s able to achieve and on virtually every aspect of life including politics, economics, and culture. 
* **Baby Boomers 嬰兒潮**
    * born between 1946 and 1964 “boomers” because there are so many of them.
    * The sheer number of people in that cohort means they’ve significantly affected every aspect of the external environment
* **Gen Y (or the “Millennials”) Y世代 千禧世代** 
    * encompass those individuals born between 1978 and 1994
    *  large in number and making its imprint on external environmental conditions as well.
* **Post-Millennials 後千禧一代**
    * the youngest identified age group—basically teens and middle-schoolers
    * has also been called the **iGeneration**, primarily because they’ve grown up with technology that customizes everything to the individual
*  The youngest group has not officially been “named,” some are referring to them as **“Gen Z”** or the **"touch-screen generation"**
    
### How the External Environment Affects Managers
Knowing what the various components of the external environment are and examining certain aspects of that environment are important to managers. 
#### JOBS AND EMPLOYMENT
* painfully obvious during the last global recession as ==millions of jobs were eliminated and unemployment rates rose== to levels not seen in many years
* businesses have been slow to reinstate jobs, creating continued hardships for those individuals looking for work
* create challenges for managers who must ==balance work demands and having enough of the right types of people with the right skills== to do the organization’s work
* recognize how these work arrangements affect the way you plan, organize, lead, and control
#### ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY
* **Environmental uncertainty** refers to the degree of change and complexity in an organization’s environment.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/4eAllw6.png)
* the degree of **change**:
    * If the components in an organization’s environment change **frequently**, it’s a **dynamic** environment. 
    * If change is **minimal**, it’s a **stable** one. : one with no new competitors, few technological breakthroughs by current competitors, little activity by pressure groups to influence the organization, and so forth
    * If change is predictable, is that considered dynamic? No. When we talk about **degree of change**, we mean change that’s unpredictable. If change can be accurately anticipated, it’s not an uncertainty for managers.
* the degree of **environmental complexity**: The number of components in an organization’s environment and the extent of the organization’s knowledge about those components
    * looks at ==the number of components in an organization’s environment== and the extent of the knowledge that the organization has about those components.
    * Complexity is also measured ==in terms of the knowledge an organization needs about its environment==.
#### MANAGING STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS
The nature of stakeholder relationships is another way in which the environment influences managers. The more obvious and secure these relationships, the more influence managers will have over organizational outcomes.  
* **Stakeholders 股東** are any constituencies 支持者 in the organization’s environment affected by an organization’s decisions and actions. 
    * have ==a stake== in or are ==significantly influenced by what the organization does== 
    * influence the organization
    * include internal and external groups
* ==lead to desirable organizational outcomes== such as improved predictability of environmental changes, more successful innovations, greater degree of trust among stakeholders, and greater organizational flexibility to reduce the impact of change
* organization depends on these external groups as ==sources of inputs (resources) and as outlets for outputs== (goods and services), managers need to consider their interests as they make decisions.

## Discuss the characteristics and importance of organizational culture. - Know how to read and assess an organization’s culture.
unique personality—traits and characteristics -> culture
### What Is Organizational Culture?
**Organizational culture**: The shared values, principles, traditions, and ways of doing things that influence the way organizational members act and that distinguish the organization from other organizations  
* **perception 見解**: not something that can be physically touched or seen
* **descriptive 可描述的**: how members perceive the culture and describe it, not with whether they like it
* **shared 共享的**: describe the organization’s culture in similar terms

![](https://i.imgur.com/aLsmdQu.png)

### Strong Cultures
**strong cultures**: Organizational cultures in which the key values are ==intensely held and widely shared==  
* ==The more employees accept== the organization’s key values and ==the greater their commitment== to those values, the stronger the culture. 
* Most organizations have moderate to strong cultures; that is, there is ==relatively high agreement on what’s important==, what defines “good” employee behavior, what it takes to get ahead, and so forth.
* The stronger a culture becomes, the more it affects the way managers plan, organize, lead, and control. 
* In organizations with strong cultures, employees are more loyal than employees in organizations with weak cultures.
* If values are ==clear and widely accepted==, employees know what they’re supposed to do and what’s expected of them, so they can ==act quickly to take care of problems==.
* The drawback is that a strong culture also might ==prevent employees from trying new approaches==, especially when conditions change rapidly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/CGQFSqj.png)

### Where Culture Comes From and How It Continues
* Company founders are not constrained by previous customs or approaches and can ==establish the early culture by articulating a vision of what they want the organization to be==.
* The small size of most new organizations makes it easier to instill that vision with all organizational members. 
* The actions of top managers also have a major impact on the organization’s culture.  
* Organizations help employees adapt to the culture through socialization, a process that helps new employees learn the organization’s way of doing things. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/a2nTxlu.png)

### How Employees Learn Culture
Employees “learn” an organization’s culture in a number of ways. The most common are **stories, rituals, material artifacts and symbols, and language.**
#### STORIES
Organizational **“stories”** typically ==contain a narrative of significant events or people==, including such things as the organization’s founders, rule breaking, reactions to past mistakes, and so forth.  
To help employees learn the culture, 
organizational stories anchor the present in the past, provide ==explanations and legitimacy for current practices, exemplify what is important to the organization==, and provide compelling pictures of an organization’s goals.
#### RITUALS
* Some rituals are rites of passage for new employees. 
* Other rituals are outwardly focused on supporting charitable causes. 
* Corporate rituals are ==repetitive sequences of activities== that express and reinforce the important values and goals of the organization.
#### MATERIAL ARTIFACTS AND SYMBOLS
Material symbols convey to employees who is important and the kinds of behavior (for example, risk taking, conservative, authoritarian, participative, individualistic, and so forth) that are expected and appropriate.
#### LANGUAGE
Many organizations and units within organizations use **language** as a way to ==identify and unite members of a culture==. By learning this language, members attest to their acceptance of the culture and their willingness to help preserve it.   
Over time, organizations often develop ==unique terms== to describe equipment, key personnel, suppliers, customers, processes, or products related to its business. New employees are frequently overwhelmed with acronyms and jargon that, after a short period of time, become a natural part of their language. Once learned, this language ==acts as a common denominator that bonds members==.

### How Culture Affects Managers
Because an organization’s culture constrains what they can and cannot do and how they manage, it’s particularly relevant to managers. Such constraints are rarely explicit. They’re not written down. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/btbIuba.png)


## Describe current issues in organizational culture
### Creating an Innovative Culture
Any successful organization needs a culture that supports **innovation**.
* the most important driver of innovation for companies was a supportive corporate culture
* a culture of management support is very important to ==the generation of innovative ideas==, but only 20 percent believe that management actually provides such support
* What does an innovative culture look like? :
    * **Challenge and involvement**—Are employees involved in, motivated by, and committed to the long-term goals and success of the organization?
    * **Freedom**—Can employees independently define their work, exercise discretion, and take initiative in their day-to-day activities?
    * **Trust and openness**—Are employees supportive and respectful of each other?
    * **Idea time**—Do individuals have time to elaborate on new ideas before taking action?
    * **Playfulness/humor**—Is the workplace spontaneous and fun?
    * **Conflict resolution**—Do individuals make decisions and resolve issues based on the good of the organization versus personal interest?
    * **Debates**—Are employees allowed to express opinions and put forth ideas for consideration and review?
    * **Risk taking**—Do managers tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity, and are employees rewarded for taking risks?

# Management History Module 
## DESCRIBE some early management examples.
* One important historical event was the publication of Adam Smith’s *Wealth of Nations*, in which he argued the benefits of division of labor (job specialization). 
* The **industrial revolution**, where it became more economical to manufacture in factories than at home. 


## EXPLAIN the various theories in the classical approach.
* **Frederick W. Taylor**, known as **the “father” of scientific management**, studied manual work using scientific principles—that is, guidelines for improving production efficiency—to find the one best way to do those jobs. 
* The **Gilbreths**’ primary contribution was finding **efficient hand-and-body motions and designing proper tools and equipment** for optimizing work performance.
* **Fayol** believed **the functions of management** were common to all business endeavors but also were distinct from other business functions.  
    * First defined the five functions.
    * Developed 14 principles of management from which many current management concepts have evolved. 
* **Weber** described an ideal type of organization he called a **bureaucracy—characteristics** that many of today’s large organizations still have. 


## DISCUSS the development and uses of the behavioral approach.
* The Hawthorne Studies dramatically affected management beliefs about the role of people in organizations, leading to a new emphasis on the human behavior factor in managing. 
* The behavioral approach has largely shaped how today’s organizations are managed. 
* Many current theories of motivation, leadership, group behavior and development, and other behavioral issues can be traced to the early OB advocates and the conclusions from the Hawthorne Studies.


## DESCRIBE the quantitative approach.
* The quantitative approach involves applications of statistics, optimization models, information models, and computer simulations to management activities. 
* Today’s managers use the quantitative approach, especially when making decisions, as they plan and control work activities such as allocating resources, improving quality, scheduling work, or determining optimum inventory levels. 


## EXPLAIN the various theories in the contemporary approach.
* The systems approach says that an organization takes in inputs (resources) from the environment and transforms or processes these resources into outputs that are distributed into the environment. 
* This approach provides a framework to help managers understand how all the interdependent units work together to achieve the organization’s goals and that decisions and actions taken in one organizational area will affect others. 
* In this way, managers can recognize that organizations are not self-contained, but instead rely on their environment for essential inputs and as outlets to absorb their outputs.

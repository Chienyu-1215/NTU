# Chapter 2 Decision Making
## Describe the eight steps in the decision-making process
Managers at all levels and in all areas of organizations **make decisions**. That is, they make choices. 
* **Decisions**: A choice among two or more alternatives

![](https://i.imgur.com/EhWZFBh.png)

### Step 1: Identify a Problem 界定問題
Every decision starts with a **problem**, a discrepancy between an existing and a desired condition.  
* **Problem**
An obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or purpose

### Step 2: Identify Decision Criteria
Every decision maker has criteria guiding his or her decisions even if they’re not explicitly stated. 
* **Decision criteria 準則**
Criteria that define what’s important or relevant to resolving a problem

### Step 3: Allocate Weights to the Criteria
If the relevant criteria ==aren’t equally important==, the decision maker must **weight** the items in order to give them the correct **priority** in the decision. 

### Step 4: Develop Alternatives
* The decision maker to ==list viable alternatives== that could resolve the problem.
* A decision maker needs to be creative, and the alternatives are only listed—not evaluated just yet.

### Step 5: Analyze Alternatives
Once alternatives have been identified, a decision maker must **evaluate** each one.   
Sometimes a decision maker might ==be able to skip== this step. If one alternative scores highest on every criterion, you wouldn’t need to consider the weights because that alternative would already be the top choice. Or if the weights were all equal, you could evaluate an alternative merely by ==summing up the assessed values for each one==. 
* 設定決策準則與其權重
* 評估各方案
    * 執行困難度
    * 達成結果可能性和程度
    * 後果或副作用之嚴重性

### Step 6: Select an Alternative
Choosing the best alternative or the one that generated the **highest** total. 

### Step 7: Implement the Alternative
* **Put the decision into action** by conveying it to those affected and getting their commitment to it. 
* **Reassess the environment** for any changes, especially if it’s a long-term decision. 

### Step 8: Evaluate Decision Effectiveness
Evaluating the outcome or result of the decision to see whether the problem was resolved.


## Explain the four ways managers make decisions
![](https://i.imgur.com/x8yBObo.png)
### Rationality 理性決策
* **Rationality Decision Making**: Describes choices that are logical and consistent and maximize value

#### ASSUMPTIONS OF RATIONALITY 
* 假設
    * 問題清晰
    * 目標清楚
    * 替代方案及結果已知
    * 決策者的偏好一致且穩定
    * 追求最佳解
* A rational decision maker would be fully **objective** and logical. 
* The problem faced would be clear and unambiguous, and the decision maker would have a clear and specific goal and know all possible alternatives and consequences. 
* Finally, making decisions rationally would consistently lead to selecting.

### Bounded Rationality 有限理性
* **Bounded rationality**: Decision making that’s **rational**, but ==limited (bounded) by an individual’s ability== to process information
* They can’t ==possibly analyze all information on all alternatives==, managers **satisfice**, rather than maximize.
    * **satisfice 最低要求**: Accept solutions that are “good enough”
* **Escalation of commitment 承諾升級**: An increased commitment to a previous decision despite evidence it may have been wrong

### Intuition 直覺
![](https://i.imgur.com/OqFV8yE.png)
* **Intuitive decision making 直覺決策**
Making decisions on the basis of experience, feelings, and accumulated judgment
* Intuitive decision making can ==complement both rational and bounded rational decision making==:
    * a manager who has had experience with a similar type of problem or situation often can ==act quickly with what appears to be limited information== because of that **past experience**
    * individuals who experienced intense feelings and emotions when making decisions actually achieved higher decision-making performance, especially when they understood their feelings as they were making decisions

### Evidence-Based Management 實證基礎管理
* **Evidence-based management (EBMgt)**
The systematic use of ==the best available evidence== to improve management practice
* The four essential elements of EBMgt
    1. the decision maker’s **expertise and judgment**; 
    2. **external evidence** that’s been evaluated by the decision maker;
    3. opinions, preferences, and values of those who have a stake in the decision;
    4. relevant organizational (internal) factors such as context, circumstances, and organizational members.


## Classify decisions and decision-making conditions
### Types of Decisions
![](https://i.imgur.com/Hx5TWQy.png)

#### STRUCTURED PROBLEMS AND PROGRAMMED DECISIONS
* **Structured problems**: Straightforward, familiar, and easily defined problems
* **Programmed decision 程式化決策**: A repetitive decision that can be handled by a **routine approach**
    * **Procedure**: ==A series of sequential steps== used to respond to a well-structured problem
    * **Rule**: An explicit statement that tells a manager what can or cannot be done
        * frequently used because they’re ==simple to follow and ensure consistency==
    * **Policy**: A guideline for making decisions
    
#### UNSTRUCTURED PROBLEMS AND NONPROGRAMMED DECISIONS
* **Unstructured Problems**: Problems that are ==new or unusual== and for which information is ambiguous or incomplete
* **Nonprogrammed Decisions**: Unique and nonrecurring decisions that require a custom-made solution

### Decision-Making Conditions
#### CERTAINTY
* **Certainty**
A situation in which a manager can make accurate decisions because all outcomes are known
#### RISK
* **Risk**
A situation in which the decision maker is able to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes
#### UNCERTAINTY 
* **Uncertainty**
A situation in which a decision maker has neither certainty nor reasonable probability estimates available  
* The choice of alternatives is influenced by the limited amount of available information and by the psychological orientation of the decision maker. 
    * An **optimistic** manager will follow a **maximax choice** (maximizing the maximum possible payoff);
    * A **pessimist** will follow a **maximin** choice (maximizing the minimum possible payoff);
    * A manager who desires to **minimize his maximum** “regret” will opt for a **minimax** choice.


## Describe how biases affect decision making
### Decision-Making Conditions
![](https://i.imgur.com/hUKfEgU.png)
* **Overconfidence bias 過度自信**: do or hold unrealistically positive views of themselves and their performance
* **Immediate gratification bias 立即滿意偏差**: describes decision makers who tend to ==want immediate rewards and to avoid immediate costs==
* **Anchoring effect 錨定效應**: decision makers ==fixate on initial information== as a starting point and then, once set, fail to adequately adjust for subsequent information 為不熟悉事物估值時，會把熟悉的類似事物或不久前接觸到的無關數值當做「錨」，估出來的數值會大大傾向「錨」
* **Selective perception bias 選擇性注意**: decision makers ==selectively organize and interpret== events based on their biased perceptions 第一印象
* **Confirmation bias 肯證**: seek out information that reaffirms their past choices and discounts ==information that contradicts past judgments== 關注、尋找、詮釋、記憶資訊的方向多半是能確認自己成見的方向
* **Framing bias 參照架構**: decision makers select and highlight certain aspects of a situation while excluding others 同一資訊以不同方式呈現方式會帶來不同想法
* **Availability bias 可得性偏誤**: decision makers tend to remember events that are ==the most recent and vivid in their memory==  容易想到的事，其發生概率會受高估，然而一件事是否容易想到還受發生多久、激起情緒的程度等因素影響，無法反映實際的發生概率
* **Representation bias 重現偏誤**: decision makers assess the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events or sets of events 參照相似具代表性事件
* **Randomness bias 隨機性偏誤**: the actions of decision makers who try to create meaning out of random events 管理者試圖從隨機事件中找出機率
* **Sunk costs error 沉沒成本**: decision makers forget that current choices can’t correct the past 決策者忘記現階段決策，無法修正過去
* **Self-serving bias 自私偏差**: quick to ==take credit for their successes== and to ==blame failure on outside== factors
* **Hindsight bias 後見之明偏差**: the tendency for decision makers to falsely believe that they would have accurately predicted the outcome of an event once that outcome is actually known

### Overview of Managerial Decision Making
Their decision-making process is affected by four factors: the decision-making approach, the type of problem, decision-making conditions, and certain decision-making errors and biases. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/LGkYwLm.png)


## Identify effective decision-making techniques
* Making good business decisions in today’s rapid-paced and messy world isn’t easy. Things happen too fast.
* Most managers make one decision after another; and as if that weren’t challenging enough, more is at stake than ever before.  

### Guidelines for Effective Decision Making
* **Understand cultural difference**
Getting work done is less likely when individuals from one culture are tone deaf to cultural norms elsewhere.
* **Create standards for good decision making**
Good decisions are forward-looking, use available information, consider ==all available and viable options==, and do ==not create conflicts of interest.==
* **Know when it’s time to call it quits**
When it’s evident that a decision isn’t working, don’t be afraid to pull the plug. 
* **Use an effective decision-making process**
    1. it focuses on what’s **important**; 
    2. it’s **logical and consistent**;
    3. it acknowledges both ==subjective and objective thinking== and blends analytical with intuitive thinking; 
    4. it requires only as much information and analysis as is necessary to resolve a particular dilemma; 
    5. it ==encourages and guides the gathering of relevant information and informed opinion==; 
    6. it’s ==straightforward, reliable, easy to use, and flexible==

### Design Thinking and Decision Making
* **Design thinking**
Approaching management problems as designers approach design problems
*  Design thinking says that managers should look at problem identification collaboratively and integratively with the goal of gaining a deep understanding of the situation.
*  Design thinking would influence how managers ==identify and evaluate alternatives==.
*  Design thinking means ==opening up your perspective and gaining insights== by using **observation and inquiry skills** and ==not relying simply on rational analysis==. 
* Design thinking also has broad implications for managers in other areas, and we’ll be looking in future chapters at its impact on innovation and strategies.

### Big Data and Decision Making
* **Big data**
The vast amount of quantifiable information that can be analyzed by highly sophisticated data processing
* Big data is a descendant of Taylor’s ‘scientific management’ of more than a century ago.
* Big data is using math modeling, predictive algorithms, and artificial intelligence software to measure and monitor people and machines like never before.


# Chapter 8 Planning and Goal-Setting
## Define the nature and purposes of planning.
### What Is Planning?
* **Planning**
Management function that involves setting goals, establishing strategies for achieving those goals, and developing plans to integrate and coordinate work activities
* When we use the term “planning,” we mean **formal planning**. In formal planning, specific goals covering a specific time period are defined. 

### Why Do Managers Plan?
* Planning ==provides direction== to managers and nonmanagers alike. 使成員瞭解為何而戰：可以凝聚協調一致的努力，並提供管理者與非管理者行事的方向
* Planning ==reduces uncertainty== by forcing managers to look ahead, anticipate change, consider the impact of change, and develop appropriate responses. *Planning won’t eliminate uncertainty, managers plan so they can respond effectively.* 降低不確定性對組織的衝擊
* Planning minimizes ==waste and redundancy==. 可減少資源重置與浪費
* Planning ==establishes the goals or standards== used in controlling. 可以提供控制所需的標準

### Planning and Performance
* Formal planning is associated with positive financial results—higher profits, higher return on assets, and so forth. 
* Doing a good ==job planning== and implementing those plans play a bigger part in high performance than how much planning is done.
* Planning didn’t lead to higher performance, the **external environment** often was the culprit.
* the planning-performance relationship seems to be influenced by the **planning time frame**. 


## Classify the types of goals organizations might have and the plans they use.
* **Goals** (objectives)
Desired outcomes or targets
* **Plans**
Documents that outline how goals are going to be met

### Types of Goals
In reality, all organizations have **multiple goals**.
* We can classify most company’s goals as either strategic or financial:
    * Financial goals are related to the ==financial performance of the organization==
    * Strategic goals are related to all other areas of an organization’s performance
* **Stated goals 陳述性目標**
Official statements of ==what an organization says==, and what it wants its various stakeholders to believe, its goals are
* **Real goals 實際目標**
Goals that an organization **actually** pursues, as defined by ==the actions of its members==

### Types of Plans
![](https://i.imgur.com/uxZ1PWW.png)

The most popular ways to describe organizational plans are **breadth** (strategic versus operational), **time frame** (short-term versus long-term), **specificity** (directional versus specific), and **frequency of use** (single use versus standing). 
* Breadth
    * **Strategic plans 策略性計劃**
        Plans that apply to the entire organization and establish the organization’s overall goals 應用於整個組織、建立組織**全面性目標**的計劃，與尋找組織所處環境中的定位。
    * **Operational plans 作業性計劃**
        Plans that encompass a particular operational area of the organization
* The number of years used to define **short-term** and **long-term** plans has declined considerably because of environmental uncertainty. Long term used to mean anything ==over seven years==. 
    * **Long-term plans**
        Plans with a time frame beyond three years
    * **Short-term plans**
        Plans covering one year or less
    * Any time period in between would be an **intermediate plan**. 
*  Specific plans would be preferable to directional, or loosely guided
    * **Specific plans 特定性計劃**
        Plans that are clearly defined and leave no room for interpretation 定義清楚而不需要多作解釋，有明確的特定目標
    * **Directional plans 方向性計劃**
        Plans that are flexible and set out general guidelines 建立一般準則的彈性計劃
* Frequency of Use
    * **Single-use plan 單一性計劃**
        A one-time plan specifically designed to meet the needs of ==a unique situation== 滿足一個特定的需求
    * **Standing plans 經常性計劃**
        Ongoing plans that provide guidance for activities performed repeatedly



## Compare and contrast approaches to goal-setting and planning.
### Approaches to Setting Goals
* **Traditional goal-setting 傳統目標設定法**
    An approach to setting goals in which ==top managers set goals== that then flow down through the organization and become subgoals for each organizational area
    * ==Turning broad strategic goals== into departmental, team, and individual goals can be a difficult and frustrating process.
    * When top managers define the organization’s goals in broad terms—such as achieving “sufficient” profits or increasing “market leadership”—these ambiguous goals have to be ==made more specific as they flow down== through the organization.
    
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/x5YF4SO.png)
* **Means-ends chain 手段目的鏈**
    An ==integrated network== of goals in which the accomplishment of goals at one level serves as the means for achieving the goals, or ends, at the next level
    
* **Management by objectives (MBO) 目標管理**
    A process of setting mutually agreed upon goals and using those goals to evaluate employee performance 由員工和經理人一起訂定明確的目標，並根據進度給予獎賞
    * MBO programs have four elements: ==goal specificity, participative decision making, an explicit time period, and performance feedback==.
    * Step 1:   The organization’s **overall objectives** and **strategies** are formulated. 訂定組織整體目標和策略
    * Step 2:   Major objectives are allocated among **divisional and departmental units**. 將主要目標賦予各分公司及部門單位
    * Step 3:   Unit managers **collaboratively set speciﬁc objectives** for their units with their managers. 各單位管理者共同合作設定明確的目標
    * Step 4:   Specific objectives are collaboratively set with **all department members**. 與所有部門成員一起設定明確目標
    * Step 5:   **Action plans**, defining how objectives are to be achieved, are specified and agreed upon by managers and employees. 經理人和員工共同決定達成目標的行動方案
    * Step 6:   The action plans are **implemented**. 執行行動方案
    * Step 7:   Progress toward objectives is periodically reviewed, and feedback is provided. 定期檢視進度，並回報問題點
    * Step 8:   Successful achievement of objectives is reinforced by performance-based rewards. 對達成目標者給予奬賞

#### CHARACTERISTICS OF WELL-WRITTEN GOALS
* Written ==in terms of outcomes== rather than actions 以結果而非以行動的方式呈現
* ==Measurable and quantiable== 可衡量且可量化
* Clear as to a ==time frame== 有明確的時間表
* Challenging yet ==attainable== 富挑戰性卻不好高騖遠
* ==Written down== 能夠以書面方式呈現
* ==Communicated== to all necessary organizational members 傳達給所有相關成員

#### STEPS IN GOAL-SETTING 
* **Mission**: The purpose of an organization
1. Review the organization’s mission, or purpose 回顧組織的使命
2. Evaluate available resources 衡量現有資源
3. Determine the goals individually or with input from others 獨力或參考他人意見來設立目標
4. Write down the goals and communicate them to all who need to know 寫出目標並且傳達給所有必要的人
5. Review results and whether goals are being met 檢查結果以確定目標是否達成

### Developing Plans
#### CONTINGENCY FACTORS IN PLANNING
Three contingency factors affect the choice of plans: organizational level, degree of environmental uncertainty, and length of future commitments.
![](https://i.imgur.com/h25W7Bm.png)
* For the most part, ==lower-level managers do operational planning== while ==upperlevel managers do strategic planning==. 基層管理者的計劃屬作業性，高階管理者的計劃則傾向於策略性
*  **Environmental uncertainty**
    1. When uncertainty is high, plans should be specific, but flexible. 當不確定性高時，計劃應該明確而有彈性
    2. Managers must be prepared to change or amend plans as they’re implemented.
* **Commitment concept** 
Plans should extend far enough to meet those commitments made when the plans were developed 要達成未來的承諾，計劃需有足夠的時間跨距

### Approaches to Planning
* In the traditional approach, planning is done ==entirely by top-level managers== who often are assisted by a **formal planning department 正式規劃部門**, ==a group of planning specialists whose sole responsibility is to help write the various organizational plans==. 
    * Although this traditional top-down approach to planning is used by many organizations, it can be effective only if ==managers understand the importance of creating documents that organizational members actually use==, not documents that look impressive but are ignored.

* Another approach to planning is to ==involve more organizational members== in the process.
    * Plans aren’t handed down from one level to the next, but instead are developed by organizational members at the various levels and in the various work units to meet their specific needs. 
    * When organizational members are more actively involved in planning, they see that the plans are more than just something written down on paper. 


## Discuss contemporary issues in planning.
### How Can Managers Plan Effectively in Dynamic Environments?
* In an uncertain environment, managers should develop plans that are specific, but flexible.
* Managers need to stay alert to environmental changes that may impact implementation and respond as needed. 
* Make the organizational hierarchy flatter to effectively plan in dynamic environments.

### How Can Managers Use Environmental Scanning?
* A manager’s analysis of the external environment may be improved by **environmental scanning**:
    * **Environmental scanning 環境掃瞄**
        Screening information to detect emerging trends
* **Competitor intelligence 競爭者情報**  
    Gathering information about competitors that allows managers to anticipate competitors’ actions rather than merely react to them
    * Much of the competitor-related information managers need to make crucial strategic decisions is available and accessible to the public
    * Competitive intelligence isn’t ==corporate espionage 企業間諜活動==
    * Competitive intelligence becomes illegal corporate spying when it involves the theft of proprietary materials or trade secrets by any mean

### Digital Tools
* **Business intelligence**
    data that managers can use to make more effective strategic decisions
    * Sources of business intelligence are company records, industry trends, and competitors’ financial (for example, profits) or market (for example, market penetration) data.
* **Digital tools**
    technology, systems, or software that allow the user to collect, visualize, understand, or analyze data

#### DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS
Methods to organize and summarize data for visual display: pie charts, bar charts, and trend lines

#### CLOUD COMPUTING
* **Cloud computing**
    Refers to storing and accessing data ==on the Internet== rather than on a computer’s hard drive or a company’s network.
    
#### INTERNET OF THINGS
* **lnternet of things**
    Allows everyday “things” to generate and store and share data across the Internet
    
    
# Chapter 9 Strategic Planning
## Define strategic management and explain why it’s important
### What Is Strategic Management?
* **Strategic management**
    What managers do to develop the organization’s strategies
* **Strategies**
The plans for how the organization will do what it’s in business to do, how it will compete successfully, and how it will attract and satisfy its customers in order 
to achieve its goals
* **Business model**
    How a company is going to make money
    1. whether customers will value what the company is providing
    2. whether the company can make any money doing that

### Why Is Strategic Management Important?
* It can make a difference in how well an organization performs.
* Managers in organizations of all types and sizes face continually changing situations.
* Organizations are complex and diverse.

![](https://i.imgur.com/k3c1Hyr.png)


## Explain what managers do during the six steps of the strategic management process
* **Strategic six-step management process**
    process that encompasses strategic planning, implementation, and evaluation
    
### Step 1: Identifying the Organization’s Current Mission, Goals, and Strategies
Every organization needs a mission—a statement of its purpose. Defining the mission forces managers to identify what it’s in business to do, but sometimes that mission statement can be too limiting. 
* **Mission**: The purpose of an organization

![](https://i.imgur.com/eVe8kEo.png)

### Step 2: Doing an External Analysis
Managers should examine the economic, demographic, political/legal, sociocultural, technological, and global components to see the trends and changes. F
* **Opportunities**
    **Positive** trends in the external environment
* **Threats**
    **Negative** trends in the external environment

### Step 3: Doing an Internal Analysis
* Provides important information about an organization’s ==specific resources and capabilities==
    * **Resources**
        An organization’s assets that are used to develop, manufacture, and deliver products to its customers
    * **Capabilities**
        An organization’s ==skills and abilities== in doing the work activities needed in its business
        * **Core competencies**
            The organization’s major value-creating capabilities that determine its competitive weapons
* After completing an internal analysis, managers should be able to identify ==organizational strengths and weaknesses==.
    * **Strengths**
        Any activities the organization does well or its unique resources
    * **Weaknesses**
        Activities the organization does not do well or resources it needs but does not possess
#### SWOT analysis
1. exploit an organization’s strengths and external opportunities, 
2. buffer or protect the organization from external threats, 
3. correct critical weaknesses.


### Step 4: Formulating Strategies
As managers formulate strategies, they should consider the realities of the external environment and their available resources and capabilities in order to design strategies that will help an organization achieve its goals. 

### Step 5: Implementing Strategies
Once strategies are formulated, they must be implemented. Performance will suffer if the strategies 
aren’t implemented properly.

### Step 6: Evaluating Results
The final step in the strategic management process is evaluating results.


## Describe the three types of corporate strategies
![](https://i.imgur.com/oLjDPrA.png)

### What Is Corporate Strategy?
* **Corporate strategy**
    An organizational strategy that determines what businesses a company ==is in or wants to be in==, and what it wants to do with those businesses
* It’s based on the mission and goals of the organization and the roles that each business unit of the organization will play

### What Are the Types of Corporate Strategy?
#### GROWTH
* **Growth strategy**
A corporate strategy that’s used when an organization wants to expand the number of markets served or products offered, either through its current business(es) or through new business(es)
* Organizations grow by using concentration, vertical integration, horizontal integration, or diversification.
    * An organization that grows using **concentration 集中** focuses on its ==primary line of business== and increases the number of products offered or markets served in this primary business. 
    * A company also might choose to grow by **vertical integration 垂直整合**, either backward, forward, or both. 
        * In **backward vertical integration**, the organization becomes its ==own supplier== so it can control its ==inputs==
        * In **forward vertical integration**, the organization becomes its ==own distributor== and is able to control its ==outputs==
    * In **horizontal integration 水平整合**, a company grows by combining with competitors
    * An organization can grow through **diversification 多角化**, either related or unrelated. 
        * **Related diversification 相關多角化** happens when a company combines with other companies in different, but **related**, industries. 企業為追求成長上的綜效(Synergy)，選擇進入(以開闢或併購等方式)與原有產品和市場「有關聯性」的產業，稱為相關多角化。
        * **Unrelated diversification 非相關多角化** is when a company combines with firms ==in different and unrelated industries== 即企業跨足兩個以上不同產業，產業間缺少技術、產品或市場上之共通點。

#### STABILITY 
* **Stability strategy 穩定策略**
    A corporate strategy in which an organization continues to do what it is currently doing 指組織會持續其現有業務的公司總體策略。 組織會持續其現有業務。
    
#### RENEWAL
* **Renewal strategy**
    A corporate strategy designed to address declining performance
* This strategy helps an organization stabilize operations, revitalize organizational resources and capabilities, and prepare to compete once again. 
* Managers do two things for both renewal strategies: ==cut costs== and ==restructure organizational operations==.
* In a turnaround strategy, these measures are more extensive than in a **retrenchment strategy**

### How Are Corporate Strategies Managed?
When an organization’s corporate strategy encompasses a number of businesses, managers can manage this collection, or portfolio, of businesses using a tool called a **corporate portfolio matrix**.
* <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG%E7%9F%A9%E9%99%A3">**BCG matrix 波士頓矩陣**</a>
    A strategy tool that guides ==resource allocation decisions== on the basis of ==market share== and ==growth rate of SBUs==
    * An organization’s various businesses could be evaluated and plotted using a ==2 × 2 matrix== to identify which ones offered ==high potential== and which were a drain on organizational resources.
    * The horizontal axis represents **market share** (low or high), and the vertical axis indicates **anticipated market growth (low or high)**. 
* A business unit is evaluated using a SWOT analysis and placed in one of the four categories, which are as follows:
    * **Stars**: High market share/High anticipated growth rate
    * **Cash Cows**: High market share/Low anticipated growth rate
    * **Question Marks**: Low market share/High anticipated growth rate
    * **Dogs**: Low market share/Low anticipated growth rate


## Describe competitive advantage and the competitive strategies organizations use to get it
* **Competitive strategy Competitive strategy**
    An organizational strategy for how an organization will compete in its business(es)

When an organization is in several different businesses, those single businesses that are independent and that have their own competitive strategies are referred to as **strategic business units (SBUs)**
* **Strategic business unit (SBU) 策略事業單位**
    The single independent businesses of an organization that formulate their own competitive strategies 以提供產品及市場區隔為主的利潤中心

### The Role of Competitive Advantage
* **Competitive advantage 競爭優勢**
    What sets an organization apart; its distinctive edge
#### QUALITY AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
* If implemented properly, quality can be a way for an organization to ==create a sustainable competitive advantage==.
* Many organizations apply quality management concepts in an attempt to set themselves apart from competitors.
* If a business is able to continuously improve the quality and reliability of its products, it may have a competitive advantage that can’t be taken away.

#### DESIGN THINKING AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
* Using design thinking means thinking in unusual ways about what the business is and how it’s doing what it’s in business to do—or as one person said, “solving wicked problems with creative resolutions by thinking outside existing alternatives and creating new alternatives.”
* Means recognizing that “design” isn’t just for products or processes but for any organizational ==work problems that can arise==. 

#### SOCIAL MEDIA AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
* Many organizations are making substantial investments in social media because its use can provide a competitive advantage.
* Successful social media strategies should
    1. help people—inside and outside the organization—connect
    2. reduce costs or increase revenue possibilities or both.
* Many are finding that social media tools can ==boost productivity==.

#### <a href="https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E4%BC%98%E5%8A%BF">SUSTAINING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 持續競爭優勢</a>
* Not every organization is able to effectively exploit its resources and to develop the core competencies that can provide it with a competitive advantage.
* The organization must be able to ==sustain that advantage==; that is, to keep its edge despite competitors’ actions or evolutionary changes in the industry.
* Market instabilities, new technology, and other changes can challenge managers’ attempts at creating a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. 

#### <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E5%8A%9B%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90">FIVE FORCES MODEL</a>
In any industry, five competitive forces dictate the rules of competition. 
1. **Threat of new entrants 來自潛在進入者的威脅**. How likely is it that new competitors will come into the industry?
2. **Threat of substitutes 來自替代品的威脅**. How likely is it that other industries’ products can be substituted for our industry’s products?
3. **Bargaining power of buyers 來自買方的議價能力**. How much bargaining power do buyers (customers) have?
4. **Bargaining power of suppliers 來自供應商的議價能力**. How much bargaining power do suppliers have?
5. **Current rivalry 來自現有競爭者的威脅**. How intense is the rivalry among current industry competitors?

#### Choosing a Competitive Strategy
* When an organization competes on the basis of ==having the lowest costs== (costs or expenses, not prices) in its industry, it’s following a **cost leadership strategy**. 
    * A low-cost leader is highly efficient. 
    * Overhead is kept to a minimum.
    * The firm does everything it can to cut costs. 
* A company that competes by offering unique products that are widely valued by customers is following a **differentiation strategy**. 
    * Product differences might come from exceptionally high quality, extraordinary service, innovative design, technological capability, or an unusually positive brand image. 
* The **focus strategy**—involves a cost advantage (cost focus) or a differentiation advantage (differentiation focus) in a narrow segment or niche.
* **Stuck in the middle**:  not a good place to be.
    * An organization becomes stuck in the middle when its costs are ==too high to compete with the low-cost leader== or when its products and services aren’t ==differentiated enough== to compete with the differentiator. 
* **Functional strategy**
    A strategy used by an organization’s various functional departments to support the competitive strategy

#### INNOVATION STRATEGIES 創新策略
* Innovation strategies aren’t necessarily focused on just the radical, breakthrough products. They can include applying existing technology to new uses. 
* Those strategies should reflect their innovation philosophy, which is shaped by two strategic decisions: **innovation emphasis** and **innovation timing**
* Managers must first decide where the emphasis of their innovation efforts will be. 
* Basic **scientific research** requires the most resource commitment because it involves the nuts-and-bolts work of scientific research. 
* Although this strategy also requires a significant resource investment, it’s not in areas associated with scientific research. 
    * Not every organization requires this extensive commitment to scientific research to achieve high performance levels. Instead, many depend on product development strategies
* The last strategic approach to innovation emphasis is a focus on **process development**. Using this strategy, an organization looks for ways to ==improve and enhance its work processes==. 
* They must decide their ==innovation timing strategy==. Some organizations want to be the first with innovations, whereas others are content to follow or mimic the innovations.
* **First mover**
    An organization that’s first to bring a product innovation to the market or to use a new process innovation.

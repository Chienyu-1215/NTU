## Pros and Cons of Three Organizational Structures – Q2
![](https://i.imgur.com/KV6BroE.png)

### Background：Entrepreneurial to Functional Structure
The original successful elements were now contributing
to its downfall.
* flexible, free-flowing job conditions doesn’t work anymore

### Functional Structure (Early Period: 1st Change)
* Hierarchical
* Not project but functional

![](https://i.imgur.com/PlGL2Tx.png)

#### Pros: Functional Structure
Task clarity
* Depth of knowledge & experience
* Promotion opportunity
* Less duplication
* Motivation improved

#### Cons: Functional Structure
* Inefficiency (poor response time & reporting)
    * Too much sub-groups in every function
    * Too much layers → cascade up and down
    * Too much functional routine work → not doing management but reporting
    * Poor integration → no one can see the bigger business/product picture
* Not enough general managers

### Background：Functional to Matrix Structure
* Launching of new products slowed down
* “Collaboration” and “responsiveness” was being eroded
* Morale was slipping
* Want to focus on specific product market
* These product-market areas had developed their own distinct consumer niche or culture

### Matrix Structure (Middle Period: 2nd Change)
* Dedicated team of each of themain product
* Dedicated product team leader who would report directly to Elizabeth
* 2 leaders:
    * functional & product team leader (i.e. matrix)
* Soft in nature

#### Pros: Matrix Structure
* High level of integration
    * efficiency remained
    * technical depth of functional organization remained
* Improved communication
* Resource sharing. (v.s. product teams)

#### Cons: Matrix Structure
* Leader is too busy
    * Both functional leaders and product team leaders will report to Elizabeth
* Potential for conflict
* Employees feel confused about their competing bosses (unity of command can be violated)
* Politics problem: resource competition

### Background：Matrix to Divisional Structure
* Elizabeth was **too busy** to referee the matrix structure
* Core talent of the company was more **varied** than before
* Hundreds of employees, with more to come

### Divisional Structure (Later Period: 3rd Change)
* Decentralized
* Each division essentially operates as its own company

![](https://i.imgur.com/KvLqK6m.png)

#### Pros: Divisional Structure
* Autonomy
* Motivated by the continued success of the company but particularly by the substantial (yet unique) opportunities in each of these marketplaces
* Accountability is razor sharp
* Coordination is fluid
* Few layers between the senior leaders and employees
* Elizabeth: have more time to think about larger strategic issues, not least possible acquisitions

#### Cons: Divisional Structure
* Redundancy and Expensive
    * requires greater focus on efficiencies, sharing and integration
* Silo Mentality: a group of people don’t share information, goals, tools, priorities or processes with other groups

## Factors of Measuring – Q3
### Factors of Measuring Organizational Structure
![](https://i.imgur.com/aNUKu6M.png)
* Larger scale
    Wildfire: By 2011, the smartphone industry has grown rapidly
    * the number of projects increased
    * More complex
    * Weak planning capability and a lack of prioritization
* Changes in production technology
    * Large-scale Production: highly standardized
    * Project Production: coordination and integration
* Changes in external environment
* Changes in strategy: Strategy leads organizational structure

### Conclusion
* Structures are not forever but must evolve to fit the times.
* Every company must find a custom-built solution.
* The key is to let the strategic context and reality guide these changes.
* Firms go through cycles of centralization and decentralization.
* Look into futuristic structures like “the network organization” or “holacracy”.

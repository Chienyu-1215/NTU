# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 14
# Foundations of Organization Structure
## Identify seven elements of an organization’s structure.

### Work specialization
the division of labor into separate activities.
* Repetition of work.
* Training for specialization.
* Increasing efficiency through invention.
* Henry Ford

Grouping jobs together so common tasks can be coordinated is called departmentalization.
* By functions performed.
* By type of product or service the organization produces.
* By geography or territory.
* By process differences.
* By type of customer.

### Chain of command
an **unbroken line** of authority that extends from the top of the organization to the lowest echelon and clarifies who reports to whom.
* Once a basic cornerstone in organization design.
* Two complementary concepts:
    * Unity of command
    * Authority

The chain of command is less relevant today because of technology and the trend of empowering people.
* Operating employees make decisions once reserved for management.
* Increased popularity of self-managed and cross-functional teams.
Many organizations still find that enforcing the chain of command is productive.

### Spans of Control

### Centralization and Decentralization
Centralization refers to the degree to which decision making is == at a single point in the organization==.  
Advantages of a decentralized organization:
* Can act more quickly to solve problems.
* More people provide input into decisions.
* Employees are less likely to feel alienated from those who make decisions that affect their work lives.

### Formalization
the degree to which jobs within the organization are **standardized 標準化**.
* A highly formalized job means a minimum amount of discretion.
* Low formalization – job behaviors are relatively non-programmed, and employees have a great deal of freedom to exercise discretion in their work.
* 缺乏彈性、創意

### Boundary spanning
Boundary spanning occurs when individuals ==form relationships with people outside their formally assigned groups==.  
Positive results are especially strong in organizations that encourage extensive internal communication; in other words, external boundary spanning is most effective when it is followed up with internal boundary spanning.



## Identify the characteristics of the functional structure, the bureaucracy, and the matrix structure.
### Simple structure

the manager and the owner are one and the same.
* Strengths:
    * Simple, fast, and flexible.
    * Inexpensive to maintain.
    * Accountability is clear.
* Weaknesses:
    * Difficult to maintain in anything other than small organizations.
    * Risky—everything depends on one person.
 
### Bureaucracy 
characterized by standardization.
* Highly routine operating tasks.
* Very formalized rules and regulations.
* Tasks grouped into functional departments.
* Centralized authority.
* Narrow spans of control.
* Decision making that follows the chain of command.
***
* Strengths:
    * Ability to perform standardized activities in a highly efficient manner.
* Weaknesses:
    * Subunit conflicts.
    * Unit goals dominate.
    * Obsessive behavior.
    * Covering weak management.
* Two aspects of bureaucracies:
    * Functional structure: groups employees by their similar specialties, roles, or tasks.
    * Divisional structure: groups employees into units by product, service, customer, or geographical market area. 

### Matrix structure

combines two forms of departmentalization—functional and product:
* The strength of functional is putting specialists together.
* Product departmentalization facilitates coordination.
    * It provides clear responsibility for all activities related to a product, but with duplication of activities and costs.


## Identify the characteristics of the virtual structure, the team structure, and the circular structure.
### The Virtual Organization

The essence of the virtual organization is that it is typically a small, core organization that outsources major business functions.
* Also referred to as a modular or network organization.
* It is highly centralized, with little or no departmentalization.

### The Team Structure
Eliminates the chain of command and replaces departments with empowered teams.
* Removes vertical and horizontal boundaries.
* Breaks down external barriers.
* Flattens the hierarchy and minimizes status and rank.  

When fully operational, the team structure may ==break down geographic barriers==.


## Describe the effects of downsizing on organizational structures and employees.
### The Leaner Organization: Downsizing
* The goal of the new organizational forms we’ve described is to improve agility by creating a lean, focused, and flexible organization.
* Downsizing is a systematic effort to make an organization leaner by selling off business units, closing locations, or reducing staff.

### Strategies for downsizing
* Investment
* Communication
* Participation
* Assistance


## Contrast the reasons for using mechanistic versus organic structural models.

An organization’s structure is a means to help management achieve its objectives.  
Most current strategy frameworks focus on three dimensions:
* Innovation strategy - Organic
* Cost Minimization strategy - Mechanistic
* Imitation strategy

### Organizational Size
Large organizations—employing 2,000 or more people—tend to have== more specialization, more departmentalization, more vertical levels, and more rules and regulations== than do small organizations.
* The impact of size becomes less important as an organization expands.

### Technology
The way an organization transfers its inputs into outputs.
* Numerous studies have examined the technology-structure relationship.
* Organizational structures adapt to their technology.
    * Mass production: assembly line (e.g. Haier)
    * Customerization 

### Environment

An organization’s environment includes outside institutions or forces that can affect its performance.
* Dynamic environments create significantly more uncertainty for managers than do static ones. 
* To minimize uncertainty:
    * Broaden structure to sense and respond to threats.
    * Form strategic alliances.



## Analyze the behavioral implications of different organizational designs.

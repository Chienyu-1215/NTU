# Organizational Change and Stress Management
## Contrast the Forces for Change and Planned Change 
![](https://i.imgur.com/uflswky.png)
* **Change** involves making something different.
* When change is an intentional, goal-oriented activity it is **planned change**.
    * There are two goals of planned change:
        * Improve the ability of the organization to adapt to changes in its environment.
        * Change employee behavior.
* **Change agents** are those responsible for managing change activities.


## Overcoming Resistance to Change 
### Individual Sources
* Habit—To cope with life’s complexities, we rely on habits or programmed responses. But when confronted with change, this tendency to respond in our accustomed ways becomes a source of resistance.
* Security—People with a high need for security are likely to resist change because it threatens their feelings of safety.
* Economic factors—Changes in job tasks or established work routines can arouse economic fears if people are concerned that they won’t be able to perform the new tasks or routines to their previous standards, especially when pay is closely tied to productivity.
* Selective information processing—Individuals are guilty of selectively processing information in order to keep their perceptions intact. They hear what they want to hear, and they ignore information that challenges the world they’ve created.

### Organizational Sources
* **Structural inertia**—Organizations have built-in mechanisms—such as their selection processes and formalized regulations—to produce stability. When an organization is confronted with change, this structural inertia acts as a counterbalance to sustain stability.
* **Limited focus of change**—Organizations consist of a number of interdependent subsystems. One can’t be changed without affecting the others. So limited changes in subsystems tend to be nullified by the larger system.
* **Group inertia**—Even if individuals want to change their behavior, group norms may act as a constraint.
* Threat to expertise—Changes in organizational patterns may threaten the expertise of specialized groups.
* **Threat to established power relationships**—Any redistribution of decision-making authority can threaten long-established power relationships within the organization.

### Overcoming Resistance to Change
* Communication
* Participation
* Building support and commitment
* Develop positive relationships
* Implementing changes fairly
* Manipulation and cooptation
* Selecting people who accept change
* Coercion

### The Politics of Change
* Change threatens the status quo, making it an inherently political activity.
* Politics suggests the impetus for change is more likely to come from:
    * Outside change agents.
    * Employees new to the organization who have less invested in the status quo.
    * Managers slightly removed from the main power structure.


## Creating a Culture for Change
### Managing a Paradox
* There is no such thing as a separate discipline of “change management” because all management is dealing with constant change and adaptation.
    * Learning
    * Organizing
    * Performing
    * Belonging
* Managers can learn a few lessons from paradox theory, which states the key paradox in management is that there is no final optimal status for an organization.

### Stimulating a Culture of Innovation
* Innovation: a more specialized kind of change, is a new idea applied to initiating or improving a product, process, or services.
* Innovations can range from small incremental improvements, such as netbook computers, to radical breakthroughs, such as Nissan’s electric 

### Sources of Innovation:
Structural variables are the most studied potential source of innovation.
* Organic structures positively influence innovation.
* Innovation-contingent rewards positively influence integration.
* Innovation is nurtured when there are slack resources.
* Inter-unit communication is high in innovative organizations.
***
Innovative organizations tend to have similar cultures:
* They encourage experimentation.
* They reward both successes and failures.
* They celebrate mistakes.  

Managers in innovative organizations recognize that failures are a natural by-product of venturing into the unknown

### Consequences of Stress
* Physiological Symptoms: research supports the link between job stress and poor health.
* Psychological Symptoms: job dissatisfaction is an obvious cause of stress.
* Behavioral Symptoms: reductions in productivity, absence, turnover, as well as changes in eating habits, increased smoking and/or consumption of alcohol, rapid speech, fidgeting, and sleep disorders.


## Managing Stress at Work 
* Because low to moderate levels of stress can be functional and lead to higher performance, management may not be concerned when employees experience stress at these levels.
* What management may consider to be “a positive stimulus that keeps the adrenaline running” is very likely to be seen as “excessive pressure” by the employee.

### Individual Approaches
* An employee can take personal responsibility for reducing stress levels.
* Individual strategies include:
    * Time-management techniques.
    * Increased physical exercise.
    * Relaxation training.
    * Expanded social support networks.

### Organizational Approaches
Several organizational factors that cause stress are controlled by management.
* Task and role demands can be modified or changed.
* Strategies include:
    * Better selection and placement, and training.
    * Goal-setting.
    * Redesigning jobs.
    * Employee involvement.
    * Organizational communication.
    * Employee sabbaticals.
    * Wellness programs.

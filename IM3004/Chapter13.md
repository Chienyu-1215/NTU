# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 13
# Leadership
## Summarize the conclusions of trait theories of leadership.
**Leadership** is the ability to influence a group toward the achievement of a vision or set of goals.
* ==Not all leaders are managers, nor are all managers leaders==.
* **Nonsanctioned leadership** is often as important or more important than formal influence.
### Trait Theories of Leadership
Trait theories of leadership focus on personal qualities and characteristics.
* The search for ==personality, social, physical, or intellectual attributes== that differentiate leaders from non-leaders goes back to the earliest stages of leadership research.
* A comprehensive review of the leadership literature, when organized around ==the Big Five==, has found **extraversion** to be the most predictive trait of effective leaders, but it is more strongly related to the way leaders emerge than to their effectiveness.
* Unlike agreeableness and emotional stability, **conscientiousness** and **openness to experience** also showed strong relationships to leadership, though not quite as strong as extraversion.
***
Good leaders who like being around people:
* Are able to assert themselves (extraverted).
* Are disciplined and able to keep commitments they make (conscientious).
* Have an apparent advantage when it comes to leadership.
* Another trait that may indicate effective leadership is **emotional intelligence**.
    * A core component of EI is **empathy**.
    * People high in EI are more likely to emerge as leaders, even after taking cognitive ability and personality into account.
***
### Two conclusions
* Traits can predict leadership.
* Traits do a better job predicting the emergence of leaders than they do at distinguishing between effective and ineffective leaders.


## Identify the central tenets and main limitations of behavioral theories.
Behavioral theories of leadership imply we can train people to be leaders.
* Ohio State Studies found two behaviors that accounted for most leadership behavior:
    * Initiating structure 辦事能力強
    * Consideration 同理心
* The **GLOBE study** suggests there are international differences in preference for initiating structure and consideration.
    * Found that leaders high in **consideration** would succeed best in where cultures did ==not favor unilateral decision making==. (low power distance): 領導者要重視員工
* Summary of Trait Theories and Behavioral Theories
    * Leaders who have certain traits and who display ==culturally appropriate== consideration and structuring behaviors do appear to be more effective.
    * Traits and behaviors do not guarantee success.
        * **Context** matters too.


## Contrast contingency theories of leadership.
The Fiedler contingency model: effective group performance depends upon the proper match between the leader’s style of interacting with subordinates and the degree to which the situation gives control to the leader.
* The ==least preferred coworker (LPC)== questionnaire:
    * Task- or relationship-oriented.
    * Assumes leadership style is fixed.
### Defining the Situation
* Contingency dimensions:
    * Leader-member relations
    * Task structure 分工結構
    * Position power 地位權力

### Situational Leadership Theory
Situational leadership theory (SLT) is a contingency theory that focuses on the ==followers==.
* Successful leadership is achieved by selecting the right leadership style, which is contingent on the level of the followers’ readiness.

### Path-goal Theory
* Contingency model of leadership that extracts key elements from the Ohio State leadership research on initiating structure and consideration and the expectancy theory of motivation.
* Derived from belief that effective leaders ==clarify the path== to help followers achieve work goals.

* Some individuals are born with charismatic traits, others are trained to exhibit charismatic behaviors.

        * Speak in an animated voice, reinforce your message with eye contact and facial expressions, and gesture for emphasis. 
        * Bring out the potential in followers by tapping into their emotions and create a bond that inspires them.

#### How Charismatic Leaders Influence Followers

* Developing a vision statement.

#### How Transformational Leadership Works
* Creativity – theirs and others.
* ==Decentralization of responsibility==.
* Propensity to ==take risks==.
* Compensation is geared toward ==long-term results==.
* Greater agreement among top managers about the organization’s goals.

#### Evaluation of Transformational Leadership
Transformational leadership has been supported at diverse job levels and occupations, but it isn’t effective in all situations.
* It has a greater impact on the bottom line in ==smaller, privately-held firms== than in more complex organizations.

#### Transformational versus Transactional Leadership
Transformational leadership is more strongly correlated with a variety of workplace outcomes.

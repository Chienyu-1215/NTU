# Statistics: Chapter 6 Probability
## Gambling and Probability
The mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyze ==games of chance== by **Gerolamo Cardano** in the sixteenth century, and by **Pierre de Fermat** and **Blaise Pascal** in the seventeenth. Christiaan Huygens published a book on the subject in 1657.

## Agenda
* Assigning Probability to Events
* Basic Relationships of Probability
* Probability Rules 
* Probability Trees
* Bayes’ Law


# Assigning Probability to Events
## Probability Theory
* Used to measure the degree of uncertainty 
* Allows decision maker to deal with uncertainty in a consistent, rational manner
* Help decision maker to make decision under uncertainty
### Uncertainty
* Future demand of products
* Future level of interest rate
* The possibility of a labor strike
* of defective chips in the next production run.

### Random Experiment
A process or course of action, whose **outcome** is **uncertain**.

### Characteristics of Probability
* Probability is a **numerical measure** of the **likelihood** that an event will occur.
* Probability values are always assigned on a scale from 0 to 1


## Determining Sample Space 
有可能發生的情形的最小單位
* Build ++an exhaustive list++ of all possible outcomes.
* Make sure the listed outcomes are ++mutually exclusive++.
A list of outcomes that meet the above two conditions is called a sample space.

### Simple Event and Event
* The individual outcome is called a simple event. A simple event cannot be further decomposed into constituent outcomes.
* An event is any collection of one or more simple events and a subset of sample space.

### Properties of Probability
Given a sample space $S ={E_1,E_2,…, E_n}$, the following characteristics for the probability, $P(E_i)$, of the Simple Event $E_i$ must hold:
1. $0 \le P(E_i) \le 1$ for eacj $i$
2. $\sum^n_{i = 1} P(E_i) = 1$

The probability of event $A$, $P(A)$, is the sum of the probabilities assigned to the simple events contained in $A$.
$P(A) = \sum_{All\space E_i\space in \space A}{P(E_i)}$


## Assigning Probability
### Classical Approach
* Deduce the probability of an outcome logically from the symmetric nature of the experiments, e.g., flipping coins, picking a porker card, …
* Assumptions: Randomness, Fairness, Equal and total information sharing
* If an experiment has $n$ possible outcomes, this method  would assign a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to each outcome. It is necessary to determine the number of possible outcomes.

### Relative Frequency Approach
Expresses an outcome’s probability as its long-run relative frequency of occurrence 

### Subjective Approach
* The experimental outcomes are **not equally likely**, and no history of repetition exists $\Rightarrow$ Subjective Probability Determination (reflects the personal evaluation of the uncertainties involved.)
* In the subjective approach we define probability as the degree of belief that we hold in the occurrence of an event

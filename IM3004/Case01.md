# Organization Behaviors Case I
# Southwest Airlines: Customer Value Proposition and Employee Satisfaction
## Airline industry
* Is airline industry attractive? 
    * Five power analysis
        * Bargaining power of consumers: high
        * Lack of differentiation among airlines: airplanes are the same, airlines can not control ground experiences, travelers will not pay for better services
        -> rivalry among existing competitors: high 
        * Bargaining power of suppliers: high (labor, airports, aircraft)
        -> Costs becomes the basis for competitive advantage
        * High fixed costs: aircraft costs, maintenance, labor, IT, landing fees, regulatory fees, fuel cost
        * Excess inventory expires when the plane takes off: complex airline pricing policy

**Airline industry is not attractive!!!**

## Imitation of Southwest 
* Is imitation of Southwest Airlines easy? 
* Imitations of Southwest airlines: most of them failed
    * Midwest express
    * America West
    * The Shuttle (United airelines)
    * Metrojet (US Airlines)
    * TED (United)
    * Continental Lite
    * JetBlue (founded by David Neeleman, founder of Morris Air, acquired by SW)


## Basis for Uniqueness in Southwest Airlines
* High labor and fleet productivity  more frequent flights
* Why is it so hard to imitate Southwest? 
    * Good labor relationships -> employee productivity -> fast turnaround time -> frequent flights -> low costs
    * What factors contribute to good labor relationships
        * Organizational culture: warrior spirits, servant’s heart, fun attitude
        * Leadership: Herb Kelleher
        * HR policies: high salaries, profit sharing
* **The whole system is hard to imitate.** 


## Is the strategy sustainable?
* Main threats to sustainability
    * Imitation
    * Change in focus (long haul, international)
    * New CEO mess things up
    * Size: SW grows too fast and culture changes
    * Industry structure changes in a way that negatively impacts Southwest
    * Fast growth becomes the objective rather than the previous controlled growth
    * Complacency and resistance to change– most likely is the most dangerous threat and one to which many successful firms have fallen victim. 


## What will keep Southwest successful? 
* Southwest continues to delivers something of value to both customers and employees. 
* The company keeps **innovating** and changing. 
* **Growth** is carefully managed to ensure that the critical elements of the customer value proposition are not damaged or destroyed. 
* Ensure that the linkages between **strategy**, culture, and leadership do not break down.

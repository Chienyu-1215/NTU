# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 11
# Power and Politics
## Contrast leadership and power.
* **Power** refers to a capacity that A has to ==influence the behavior of B==, so that B ==acts in accordance with A’s wishes==.
    * Power may exist but not be used.
* Probably the most important aspect of power is that it is a function of **dependence**.
    * A person can have power over you only if he or she controls something you desire.
* Leaders use power as a means of attaining group goals.
* However, they are different:
    * **Goal compatibility**
        * Power does not require goal compatibility, merely dependence.
    * **The direction of influence**
        * Leadership focuses on the downward influence on one’s followers.
    * Leadership research emphasizes **style**
        * Leadership: personal influence
        * Power: resources


## Explain the three bases of formal power and the two bases of personal power.
* **Formal Power** 組織、職位給予
    * Coercive Power 強制權力
        可以對違背旨意的人進行懲戒
    * Reward Power 獎賞權力
        基於給予正面有利結果，或去除負面不利結果
    * Legitimate Power 法定權力
* Personal Power
    * Expert Power 專家權力
        來自個人所擁有的專長、專門知識、特殊技能
    * Referent Power 參照權力
        成為別人學習參照榜樣
### Which Bases of Power Are Most Effective?
* **Personal sources** are most effective.
* Both expert and referent power are positively related to employees’ satisfaction with supervision, their organizational commitment, and their performance, whereas reward and legitimate power seem to be unrelated to these outcomes.
* Coercive power can be **damaging**.


## Explain the role of dependence in power relationships.
### The General Dependency Postulate
When you possess anything others require but that you alone control, you make them dependent upon you and, therefore, you gain power over them.
Dependence, then, is inversely proportional to the alternative sources of supply.
### What Creates Dependence?
* Importance 重要性
* Scarcity 稀有性
* Nonsubstitutability



## Identify power or influence tactics and their contingencies.

### Influence tactics 影響策略
* Legitimacy 合法性
* Rational persuasion 提出解釋
* Inspirational appeals 啟發激勵
* Consultation 協商、徵求專業經歷
* Exchange 直接交換
* Personal appeals 訴諸個人目標
* Ingratiating 逢迎策略
* Pressure 施壓策略
* Coalitions 結盟策略
***
* Some tactics are more effective than others.
    * Rational persuasion, inspirational appeals, and consultation are most effective when the audience is highly interested in the outcomes.
    * Pressure tends to backfire.
    * Both ingratiation and legitimacy can lessen the negative reactions from appearing to “dictate” outcomes.

* People in different countries prefer different power tactics.
    * Individualistic countries see power in personalized terms and as a legitimate means of advancing their personal ends.
    * Collectivistic countries see power in social terms and as a legitimate means of helping others.
    * US managers prefer rational appeal, whereas Chinese managers prefer coalition tactics. 
### Applying Power Tactics
* People differ in terms of their political skill: their ability to influence others to enhance their own objectives.
    * The politically skilled are more effective users of all the influence tactics.
* Cultures within organizations differ markedly: some are warm, relaxed, and supportive; others are formal and conservative.
    * People who fit the culture of the organization tend to obtain more influence.


## Identify the causes and consequences of abuse of power.
### Does power corrupt? 
**The answer is likely to be yes**  
* Power leads people to ==place their own interests ahead== of others.
* Powerful people react, especially negatively, to any threats to their competence.
* Power leads to ==overconfident decision making==.
* Power doesn’t affect everyone in the same way, and there are even positive effects of power.

### Sexual harassment 性騷擾
Any unwanted activity of a sexual nature that affects an individual’s employment and creates ==a hostile work environment==.
* Organizations have generally made progress in the past decade toward ==limiting overt== forms of sexual harassment.
* Managers have a responsibility to protect their employees from a hostile work environment, but they also need to protect themselves.
* Mangers should:
    * Make sure an ==active policy== defines what constitutes sexual harassment, informs employees they can be fired for sexually harassing another employee, and establishes procedures for how complaints can be made.
    * Reassure employees that they will not encounter retaliation if they issue a complaint.
    * Investigate every complaint and include the legal and human resource departments.
    * Make sure offenders are disciplined or terminated.
    * Set up in-house seminars to raise employee awareness of the issues surrounding sexual harassment.


## Describe how politics work in organizations.
### Political behavior
Activities that are not required as part of one’s formal role in the organization, but that influence the distribution of advantages within the organization.
* Outside of one’s specified job requirements.
* Encompasses efforts to influence decision- making goals, criteria, or processes.
* Includes such behaviors as withholding information, whistle-blowing, spreading rumors, and leaking confidential information.

### Impression management (IM)
The process by which individuals ==attempt to control the impression others== form of them.  
* Mostly high **self-monitors**.
* Impressions people convey are not necessarily false – they might truly believe them.
* **Intentional misrepresentation** may have a high cost.
* The effectiveness of IM depends on the situation.
    * Self promotion works well in job interview, but backfires in performance evaluation

### The Ethics of Behaving Politically
Questions to consider:
What is the utility of engaging in politicking?
How does the utility of engaging in the political behavior balance out any harm (or potential harm) it will do to others?
Does the political activity conform to standards of equity and justice?

    * Enron used long-term fixed-price contracts to purchase gas from producers and financial derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in spot prices on future gas purchases required to meet the delivery commitments of long-term customer contracts
* Extensions the trading model and huge success (applauded as one of the best companies in US, many awards)

## How could Jeff Skilling have allowed this to happen? 
* Background of Jeff Skilling
    * Harvard graduated, 5% of his class
    * Brilliant, successful, arrogant
* All reports on Skilling indicated that he was both smart and arrogant – a pretty deadly combination
* Widely applauded as brilliant. 
* Skilling aggressively pushed for extensions of business model. Early success with gas and electricity may have led to hubris. 
* Skilling strongly supported incentive policies & extensions of strategy. He considered them to be among the company’s strengths. 


## Wrap up
* The combination of Enron’s business strategy, incentives and its internal controls makes the company like a car with a Lamborgini body and engine, but Chevrolet brakes. 
* Lay and Skilling became ++business icons++. People do not believe their own press, and underestimate downside risks. 
* ++Iconic leaders++ are prone to either actively discouraging dissent, or failing to appreciate how their own power and success make it difficult for others to express dissenting points of view. 
* ++Governance is only effective if it is taken seriously by top management++. It is easy to get into a check-the-box mentality that leads the organization to appear to have the requisite controls, which are not taken seriously.

# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 12
# Communication
## Describe the functions and process of communication.
Communication serves five major functions within a group or organization:
* Management
* Feedback
* Emotional sharing
* Persuasion
* Information exchange

### Management
* Communication acts to manage member behavior in several ways.
* Authority hierarchies and formal guidelines.
* Job descriptions and company policies.
* Workgroup teasing or harassing.

### Emorional Sharing
* Communication creates feedback by clarifying to employees what they must do, how well they are doing it, and how they can improve their performance. Communication within the group is a fundamental mechanism by which members show satisfaction and frustration. 
* Communication, therefore, provides for the emotional sharing of ==feelings and fulfillment of social needs==.


### Persuation
* Like emotional sharing, persuasion can be good or bad depending on if, say, a leader is trying to persuade a workgroup to believe in the organization’s commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) or to, conversely, persuade the workgroup to break the law to meet an organizational goal.
* Persuasion can benefit or harm an organization.


### Information Exchange 
The final function of communication is information exchange to facilitate decision making.
Communication provides the information individuals and groups need to make decisions by transmitting the data needed to identify and evaluate choices.

## Contrast downward, upward, and lateral communication through small-group networks and the grapevine.
### Downward communication 
Flows from one level to a lower level.
* Assign goals, provide instructions, communicate policies and procedures, and provide feedback.
* Downward communication must explain the reasons why a decision was made.
* One problem is the one-way nature of downward communication.

### Upward communication
Flows to a higher level in the group or organization.
* Provide feedback to higher-ups, inform them of progress, and relay current problems.
    * Communicate in headlines, not paragraphs.
    * Support your headlines with actionable items.
    * Prepare an agenda to make sure you use your boss’s attention well.

### Lateral communication
Takes place among members of the same work group, among members of work groups at the same level, among managers at the same level, or among any horizontally equivalent personnel.
* Often necessary to save time and facilitate coordination.
* May be formally sanctioned.
* Can create dysfunctional conflicts.

### Grapevine
The **informal** communication network in a group or organization is called the **grapevine**.  
It gives managers a feel for the **morale** of their organization, identifies issues employees consider important, and helps tap into employee anxieties.

## Contrast oral, written, and nonverbal communication.
### Oral Communication

* Meetings
* Videoconferencing and conference calling
* Telephone

### Written Communication
* Letters
* PowerPoint
* E-mail
* Instant Messaging
* Text Messaging
* Social Media
* Aps
* Blogs

### Nonverbal Communication
Includes body movements, the intonations or emphasis we give to words, facial expressions, and the physical distance between the sender and receiver.
* Body language can convey status, level of engagement, and emotional state.


## Describe how channel richness underlies the choice of communication channel.
![](https://i.imgur.com/8e6oZEs.png)
* The choice of channel depends on whether the message is routine.
    * Routine messages tend to be straightforward and have a minimum of **ambiguity 模糊度**.
        * Choose oral communication when you need to gauge the receiver’s receptivity.
        * Written communication is more reliable for complex and lengthy communications.


## Differentiate between automatic and controlled processing of persuasive messages.


## Identify common barriers to effective communication.
Barriers to Effective Communication
* **Filtering**
* Selective perception 選擇性認知
* Information overload 訊息過量
* Emotions
* Language
* Silence
* **Communication apprehension**
* Lying

### Cultural Barriers
* Caused by semantics – words mean different things to different people.
* Caused by word connotations – words imply different things in different languages.
* Caused by tone differences.
* Caused by differences in tolerance for conflict and methods for resolving conflicts.


## Discuss how to overcome the potential problems of cross-cultural communication.

## Describe Personality, the Way It Is Measured, and the Factors that Shape It
### Defining Personality
* Personality is a dynamic concept describing the growth and development of a person’s whole psychological system.
* The sum of ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others.

    **Person - Job Fit**
### Measuring Personality
* Managers need to know how to measure personality.
    * Personality tests are useful in hiring decisions and help managers forecast who is best for a job.
* The most common means of measuring personality is through self-report surveys.
### Personality Determinants
**Nature v.s. Nurture**
* Is personality the result of heredity or environment?
* Heredity refers to those factors that were determined at conception.
    * The heredity approach argues that the ultimate explanation of an individual’s personality is the molecular structure of the genes, located in the chromosomes.


## Strengths and Weakness of the MBTI and Big Five Model 
### The most widely used personality framework is ++the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)++.
Individuals are classified as:
* Extroverted or Introverted (E or I)
* Sensing or Intuitive (S or N)
* Thinking or Feeling (T or F)
* Perceiving or Judging (P or J)
* INTJs are visionaries.
* ESTJs are organizers.
* ENTPs are conceptualizers.

### The Big Five Model
* Extraversion 外向性
* Agreeableness 隨和、順從
* Conscientiousness 勤勉盡責
* Emotional stability
* Openness to experience

### The Dark Triad 
* Machiavellianism: the degree to which an individual is pragmatic, maintains emotional distance, and believes that ends can justify means. 喜歡操弄他人
* Narcissism: the tendency to be arrogant, have a grandiose sense of self-importance, require excessive admiration, and have a sense of entitlement. 自戀
* Psychopathy: the tendency for a lack of concern for others and a lack of guilt or remorse when their actions cause harm.

An emerging framework to study dark side traits:
* First, antisocial people are indifferent and callous toward others.
* Second, borderline people have low self-esteem and high uncertainty.
* Third, schizotypal individuals are eccentric and disorganized.
* Fourth, obsessive compulsive people are perfectionists and can be stubborn, yet they attend to details, carry a strong work ethic, and may be motivated by achievement.
* Fifth, avoidant individuals feel inadequate and hate criticism.


## CSE, Self-Monitoring, and Proactive Personality 
Other Personality Traits Relevant to OB
### Core Self-Evaluation
bottom line conclusions individuals have about their capabilities, competence, and worth as a person.
### Self-Monitoring
measures an individual’s ability to adjust his or her behavior to external, situational factors.
### Proactive Personality 
people who identify opportunities, show initiative, take action, and persevere until meaningful change occurs. 積極、願意嘗試


## The Situation, Job Search, and Unemployment 
What personality characteristics predict job search behaviors among the unemployed? 
* Conscientiousness and extraversion are the two strongest predictors of job search behavior,
    * Self-esteem and self-efficacy (parts of CSE) are also important.


## The Situation, Personality, and Behavior
### Situation strength theory (情境強度理論, SST)
indicates that the way personality translates into behavior depends on the strength of the situation.
* The degree to which norms, cues, or standards dictate appropriate behavior.
    * Clarity 工作任務權責內容
    * Consistency 工作任務各方期待一致性
    * Constraints 個人決策自由度
    * Consequences 個人影響力

### 特質活化理論(trait activation theory, TAT) 
* 某些情境、事件或干預比較容易「活化」某種特質。例如鼓勵創造的組織，開放性比外向性更能預測績效表現。
* 運用TAT，我們可以預知哪些工作適合特定人格。

* 兩者皆有研究實證支持(Judge, & Zapata, 2015)

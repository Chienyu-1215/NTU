# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 9
# Foundations of Group Behavior
## Distinguish Between Different Types of Groups 
A group is defined as two or more individuals, interacting and **interdependent** 高度依賴性, who have ==come together to achieve particular objectives==.  

* **Formal groups 正式團體**: those defined by ==the organization’s structure==.
    * 組織架構：樹狀圖
* **Informal groups 非正式團體**: alliances that are ==neither formally structured nor organizationally determined==. 有共同興趣的交流團體。  

**Social identity theory**: considers when and why individuals consider themselves members of groups. 對組織群體的認同，會讓我們用群體表現的結果，影響我們的心情。
* People have ==emotional reactions== to the failure or success of their group because their ==self-esteem gets tied into the performance of the group==.
* Social identities help us understand who we are and where we fit in with people.  

### Ingroups and Outgroups
* **Ingroup favoritism** occurs when we see ==members of our group as better than other people==, and people not in our group as all the same.特別偏好自己圈內的人員
* Whenever there is an ingroup, there is by necessity an **outgroup**, which is sometimes everyone else, but is usually an identified group known by the ingroup’s members.
* Often results in that members of the outgroup perform worse than those of ingroup since they fail to get respect from doing the job. 

### Social Identity Threat
* Ingroups and outgroups pave the way for social identity threat, which is akin to stereotype threat.
* Individuals believe they will be personally negatively evaluated due to their association with a devalued group, and they may ==lose confidence and performance effectiveness==.

## Group property 1: Show How Role Requirements Change 
**Role**: a set of ==expected behavior patterns== attributed to someone occupying a given position in a social unit.
* **Role perception 角色認知**: one’s perception of how to act in a given situation.
* **Role expectations 角色期待**: how others believe one should act in a given situation.
    * **Psychological contract 心理契約**：
        個人將有所奉獻與組織欲望有所獲取之間，以及組織將針對個人期望收穫而提供的一種配合。
* **Role conflict 角色衝突**: situation in which an individual faces ==divergent role expectations==.
    * We can experience ==interrole conflict== when the expectations of our different, separate groups are ==in opposition==.
* **Role Play and Assimilation 角色扮演、同化**
    * Philip Zimbardo’s prison experiment.
        Participants easily and rapidly assumed roles that were very different from their inherent personalities.


## Group Property 2: Show How Norms Exert Influence On An Individual’s Behavior 
### Norms 規範
==Acceptable standards of behavior== within a group that are shared by the group’s members. 不成文發展而出受眾人認同的行為規範
* **Peer pressure** 同儕壓力
    大家都做一件事時，都被認同這樣做才是對的。
* Political correctness

### Norms and Emotions
* A recent study found that, in a task group, individuals’ emotions influenced the group’s emotions and vice versa.
* Researchers have also found that norms dictated the experience of emotions for the individuals and for the groups – in other words, people grew to interpret their shared emotions in the same way.

### 艾許效應

### Hawthorne study 霍桑實驗
* Study the relationship between physical environment and productivity
* Findings: Productivity continued to increase as the light level dropped
* Increased attentions lead to productivity

1. 改變工作條件和勞動效率之間沒有直接的因果關係；
2. 提高生產效率的決定因素是員工情緒，而不是工作條件；
3. 關心員工的情感和員工的不滿情緒，有助於提高勞動生產率；
4. 當員工覺得自己被看重時，績效提升。

### Using peer pressure as an influence tactic
Influence from the group to act the same
* Positive impacts
* Negative impacts
要善用對群體的影響來進行組織管理

### Positive Norms and Group Outcomes
* One goal of every organization with ==corporate social responsibility (CSR)== initiatives is for its values to hold normative sway over employees.
* If employees ==aligned their thinking with positive norms==, these norms would become stronger and the probability of positive impact would grow exponentially.
    * Positive group norms may well beget positive outcomes, but only if other factors are present. (acceptance of norms)

### Norms and Culture
* Do people in collectivist cultures have different norms than people in individualist cultures? Of course they do.
* But did you know that our orientation may be changed, even after years of living in one society.


## Group Property 3: Show How Status and Size Differences Affect Performance
### Status 地位
a socially defined position or rank given to groups or group members by others.  
**Status characteristics theory**: status is derived from one of three sources:
* The power a person wields over others.
* A person’s ability to contribute to a group’s goals.
* An individual’s personal characteristics.  
---
* Status and Norms: high status individuals often have ==more freedom to deviate from norms==.
* Status and Group Interaction: high status people are often more ==assertive==.
* Status Inequity: perceived inequity creates disequilibrium and can lead to resentment and corrective behavior.
* Status and Stigmatization: stigma by association.
* Group Status: “us and them” mentality and ensuing polarization. 


## Group Property 4:　Show How Size Differences Affect Performance
Group size affects the group’s overall behavior.
* Large groups are good for gaining diverse input.
* Smaller groups are better doing something with input.
### Social loafing 社會賦閒
the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than alone. 人力過剩、搭便車效應
#### How to prevent social loafing
* Set group goals 設定目標
* Increase intergroup competition 增加群體間競爭
* Engage in peer evaluations 同儕互評
* Select members who have high motivation and prefer to work in groups 挑選對工作較有動機、熱忱者
* Base group rewards in part on each member’s unique contributions


## Group Property 5 & 6：Integrating Cohesiveness and Diversity for Group Effectiveness
![](https://i.imgur.com/gG9i9lj.png)
* Cohesiveness 團隊向心力
* Performance Norms 組織規範
### Diversity
Degree to which members of the group are similar to, or different from, one another.  
* Increases group conflict, especially in the short term.
* **Faultlines**: the perceived division that split groups into subgroups (sex, race, age, education) 讓跨群體溝通困難  

Culturally and demographically diverse groups may perform better over time.

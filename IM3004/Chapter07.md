# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 7
# Motivation Concepts
## Describe the Three Key Elements of Motivation 
* Motivation is the processes that account for an individual’s intensity, direction, and persistence of effort toward attaining a goal.
* The level of motivation varies both between individuals and within individuals at different times.
* The three key elements of motivation are:	
    1. Intensity: concerned with how hard a person tries.
    2. Direction: the orientation that benefits the organization.
    3. Persistence: a measure of how long a person can maintain his/her effort.


## Compare the Early Theories of Motivation
### Maslow’s need theory

Maslow’s need theory has received wide recognition, particularly among practicing managers.
* It is intuitively logical and easy to understand and some research has validated it.
* However, most research does not, and it hasn’t been frequently researched since the 1960s.

### Frederick Herzberg's Comparison of Satisfiers and Dissatisfiers

### McClelland’s Theory of Needs
The theory focuses on three needs:
* Need for achievement (nAch): drive to excel, to achieve in relation to a set of standards, to strive to succeed.
* Need for power (nPow): need to make others behave in a way that they would not have behaved otherwise.
* Need for affiliation (nAfl): desire for friendly and close interpersonal relationships.


## Self-Determination Theory vs. Goal-Setting Theory 
### Self-Determination Theory 人是環境的產物
* People prefer to feel they have control over their actions.
    * Focus on the beneficial effects of intrinsic motivation and harmful effects of extrinsic motivation. 
    * Cognitive evaluation theory - When people are paid for work, it feels less like something they want to do and more like something they have to do.
* Proposes that in addition to being driven by a need for autonomy, people seek ways to achieve competence and positive connections to others. 
* When extrinsic rewards are used as payoffs for performance, employees feel they are doing a good job.
    * Eliminating extrinsic rewards can also shift an individual’s perception of why he or she works on a task from an external to an internal explanation.
* Self-determination theory acknowledges that extrinsic rewards can improve even intrinsic motivation under specific circumstances.
* What does self-determination theory suggest for providing rewards?
* Self-concordance: considers how strongly people’s reasons for pursuing goals are consistent with their interests and core values.

What does all of this mean?
* For individuals:
    * Choose your job for reasons other than extrinsic rewards.
* For organizations:
    * Provide intrinsic as well as extrinsic incentives.
### Goal-Setting Theory
Goals tell an employee what needs to be done and how much effort is needed.
#### Evidence suggests:
* Specific goals increase performance.
* Difficult goals, when accepted, result in higher performance than do easy goals.
* Feedback leads to higher performance than does non-feedback.
#### Goals-performance Relationship
Three other factors influencing the goals-performance relationship:
* Goal commitment: high
* Task characteristics: easy, independent jobs
* National culture: power distance
    * High: tend to accept assigned job goals  
Goals may be too effective: focused on outcome and ignored learning process
* Undermine adaptation and creativity

People differ in the way they regulate their thoughts and behaviors when pursuing goals.
* Those with a promotion focus strive for advancement and accomplishment and approach conditions that move them closer toward desired goals. (benefits)
    * Works better for goals related to creativity
* Those with a prevention focus strive to fulfill duties and obligations and avoid conditions that pull them away from desired goals. (risks)
    * Works better for goals related to security

### Goal Setting and Ethics
* The relationship between goal setting and ethics is quite complex: if we emphasize the attainment of goals, what is the cost?
* We may forgo mastering tasks and adopt avoidance techniques so we don’t look bad, both of which can incline us toward unethical choices.


## Self-Efficacy, Reinforcement, and Expectancy Theory 
Self-efficacy 自我評估 theory is an individual’s belief that he or she is capable of performing a task. 
* Four ways to improve self-efficacy
    * Enactive mastery
    * Vicarious modeling
    * Verbal persuasion
    * Arousal  
Also known as social cognitive theory and social learning theory.

Three relationships:
* Effort-performance relationship 努力與績效 > Self-Efficacy
* Performance-reward relationship 績效和獎賞 > Reinforcement
* Rewards-personal goals relationship 獎賞與個人 > Expectancy

Performance - Reward must have a close relationship.
When employees perceive an inequity, they can be predicted to make one of six choices:
* Change inputs.
* Change outcomes.
* Distort perceptions of self.
* Distort perceptions of others.
* Choose a different referent.
* Leave the field.


## Implications of Job Engagement for Management
What makes people more engaged in their job?
* The degree to which an employee believes it is meaningful to engage in work.
* A match between the individual’s values and the organization’s.
* Leadership behaviors that inspire workers to a greater sense of mission.

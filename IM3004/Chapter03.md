    * They reflect how we feel about something.

### Summarize the Relationship Between Attitudes and Behavior 
* The attitudes that people hold determine what they do.
    * Festinger: cases of attitude following behavior illustrate the effects of cognitive dissonance.
    * Cognitive dissonance認知失調 is any incompatibility an individual might perceive between two or more attitudes or between behavior and attitudes.
* Research has generally concluded that *people seek consistency among their attitudes and between their attitudes and their behavior*.
* Moderating Variables:
    * Attitude’s importance
    * Correspondence to behavior
    * Accessibility
    * Presence of social pressures
    * Whether a person has direct experience with the attitude
* The attitude-behavior relationship is likely to be much stronger if an attitude refers to something with which we have direct personal experience.

* Organizational Commitment
    * Identifying with a particular organization and its goals and wishing to maintain membership in the organization.
    * Employees who are committed will be less likely to engage in work withdrawal even if they are dissatisfied, because they have a sense of organizational loyalty.
* Perceived Organizational Support (POS)
    * Degree to which employees believe the organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being.
    * Higher when rewards are fair, employees are involved in decision making, and supervisors are seen as supportive.

#### Summarize the Main Causes of Job Satisfaction 
* What causes job satisfaction?
    * Job conditions
        The intrinsic nature of the work itself, social interactions, and supervision are important predictors of satisfaction and employee well-being.
    * Personality
        People who have positive core self-evaluations, who believe in their inner worth and basic competence, are more satisfied with their jobs than those with negative core self-evaluations.
* Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
    * Corporate social responsibility (CSR): self-regulated actions to benefit society or the environment beyond what is required by law.
        * Includes environmental sustainability initiatives, nonprofit work, and charitable giving.

Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB)
* Counterproductive work behavior: actions that actively damage the organization, including stealing, behaving aggressively toward coworkers, or being late or absent.
* Absenteeism: the more satisfied you are, the less likely you are to miss work.
* Turnover: a pattern of lowered job satisfaction is the best predictor of intent to leave.

# Organizational Behaviors - Chapter 5
# Perception and Individual Decision Making
## Explain the Factors That Influence Perception 
* Perception is a process by which individuals organize and interpret their sensory impressions to give meaning to their environment.
* It is important to the study of OB because people’s behaviors are based on their perception of what reality is, not on reality itself.

## Explain Attribution Theory
* Attribution theory suggests that when we observe an individual’s behavior, we attempt to determine whether it was internally or externally caused.
* Determination depends on three factors:
    * Distinctiveness
    * Consensus
    * Consistency
* Clarification of the differences between internal and external causation
    * Internally caused – those that are believed to be under the personal control of the individual. 內部
    * Externally caused – resulting from outside causes. 外在

* Fundamental attribution error 
    * We have a tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal or personal factors. 多將好事歸因給內在，將錯推給外在
* Self-serving bias 
    * Individuals attribute their own successes to internal factors.

### Common Shortcuts in Judging Others
* Selective perception
    * Any characteristic that makes a person, object, or event stand out will increase the probability that it will be perceived.
    * Since we can’t observe everything going on around us, we engage in selective perception.
* Halo effect
    * The halo effect occurs when we draw a general impression based on a single characteristic.
* Contrast effects
    * We do not evaluate a person in isolation.
    * Our reaction to one person is influenced by other persons we have recently encountered.
* Stereotyping
    * Judging someone based on one’s perception of the group to which that person belongs.
    * We have to monitor ourselves to make sure we’re not unfairly applying a stereotype in our evaluations and decisions.


## 方案預期理論(Prospect theory, Tversky & Kahneman)
* 框架效應(Framing effect): 正面框架陳述時風險偏好是規避風險, 負面框架陳述時風險偏好是追求風險
* 規避損失（loss aversion):正面框架陳述時,在確定利得與可能利得擇一,選擇確定利得,故風險偏好是規避風險；負面框架陳述時,在確定損失與可能損失擇一,選擇可能損失,故風險偏好是追求風險
* 短視近利 (myopia): 受眼前利得或損失的影響而忽略長期的資產結果

### 框架效應對決策品質的影響
* 決策 I: 
    A. 確定贏$240  (84%)
    B. 25%的機會贏$1,000, 75%的機會一無所獲  (16%)  
* 決策 II: 
    C. 確定損失$750  (13%)
    D. 75%的機會損失$1000, 25%的機會沒有任何損失  (87%) 
* 決策 III: 
    E. 25%的機會贏$240, 75%的機會損失$760  (14%)
    F. 25%的機會贏$250, 75%的機會損失$750  (86%)
*  A + D = E
    $(100\%)\times(240) + [(75\%)\times(-1000)+(25\%) \times(0)] =(25\%)*(240) + (75\%)*(-760)$
*  B + C = F
    $[(25\%)\times(1000) + (75\%)\times(0)]+ (100
    \%)\times(-750) = (25\%)\times(250) + (75\%)\times(-750)$
* 框架效應可以解釋為何許多投資人沒有獲利

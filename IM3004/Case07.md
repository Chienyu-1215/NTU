## Definition of a Network
* The set of relationships critical to your ability to get things done, get ahead and develop professionally
* Includes
    * Expressive and task-based networks
    * Simplex and multiplex relationships


## Social capital
* **Social capital**: resources provided by and traded in networks of relationships: access to information, influence and support
* Depends on three aspects of networks
* Types of people, types of relationships and links to key people
    * Types of people: levels, functions and subunits, external groups, identity groups
    * Types of relationships: core network (long-term, high-reciprocity ties; short-term, instrumental ties), extended network
    * Links to key networks


## Basic Assumptions
The structure of your network and the location of your relational ties in broader networks determines:
* Degree of access to information, resources, referrals, opportunities, support
* Ability to create and mobilize linkages among relevant players
* Ability to add value to your network


## 3 Network-Building Steps
* Network Diagnosis
    * Identify patterns and preferences
    * Assess gaps, given your goals
* Network Development/Alignment
    * Develop strategies and tactics for creating new ties
    * Give people a reason to want a relationship with you
* Network Maintenance
    * Keep infrequent contacts “active”
    * Balance short/long term goals


## Diagnosis: 3 Characteristics of Successful Networks
### Range of relational types: Breadth
Value-added function of number of sectors you can reach and connect:
* Expressive ties for support; task ties for access
* Within and outside professional specialty
* Private, public, non-profit sectors
* Community groups, clubs
* Industry contacts, professional associations
* “identity” groups

### Strength of ties: Depth
* Strong ties: core network (affective or primary ties)
    * Similarity principle: circle of trust, reliability
    * Immediate task, professional & career support
* Weak ties: extended network
    * Diversity principle: “six degrees of separation”
    * New/unanticipated opportunities, indirect access
* How many people did you list in response to all three questions?
    * frequency of interactions, strength of attachments, and multiplexity of relationships

### Density of network: Leverage
* Density of network 效應成U字型
    * Non-redundant contacts are more efficient
    * Redundant contacts provide support and identity
* Structural holes
    * Brokers add value to networks
    * Brokers can access unique resources, information
    * Focus resources on maintaining primary ties (Burt)


## Important positions in networks: center and bridge
### Centrality:
* Degree is ==the number of contacts== to which one is directly connected and thus measures activity of the actor. 
* Betweenness is the extent to which an actor is ==the shortest route between other pairs of actors== and thus measures potential control over others. 
* Closeness is the extent to which an actor can reach all other actors through the shortest path and thus measures the independence of the actor from relying on others
### Structural holes
* According to Burt, a “structural hole” is ==the separation between non-redundant contacts==
* The position that spans a structural hole is an entrepreneurial one, allowing the spanning actor to gain significant advantages in information, access, and control.


## Building a useful network
Two basic principles govern the development of informal relationship networks: similarity and exchange
* **Similarity**: the tendency for relationships to develop spontaneously between people who share common background
* **Exchange**: difference is what makes many ties useful, since it increases the likelihood that each party has complementary resources to exchange with each other


## Managing and using the network
* In organizations, few transactions are one-shop deals. Most are ongoing exchanges of favors. 
    * Success in achieving the objective (keep promise)
    * Success in improving the relationship
* Central network position
* **Reciprocity 互惠**
* Avoid becoming overly dependent on one person or on only a few network relationships
